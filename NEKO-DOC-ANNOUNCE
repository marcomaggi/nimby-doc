Details for 2008-08-19
----------------------

I have combed the text  in the Neko language chapters and (I
think) completed the reference  for the Neko library.  Still
to  do  is  a  complete  revision  of the  FFI  and  of  the
"embedding Neko" chapter.  This should be a usable revision,
so  if some  kind soul  wants to  beta-read it,  I  would be
thankful.
