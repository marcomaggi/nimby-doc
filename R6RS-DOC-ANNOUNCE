SUBJECT: [announce] Texinfo R6RS, 2008-11-05-21-32-46


Although I understand that Texinfo is for the rest of us, as
a  byproduct of  things I  am  interested in  I release  the
following:

I accept  "bug" reports and contributions  (anybody wants to
reformat the references and citations sections?).  Thanks to
the  R6RS  editors  for  freely  distributing  the  original
documents.


Details for 2008-11-05-21-32-46
-------------------------------

* Applied the errata corrige (as much as I could).
* Not perfect,  obviously.  All  the greek letters  and math
  special symbols are  omitted, causing examples surrounding
  them to be omitted.
* The formal semantics appendix is omitted from the report.
* The references and citations  sections are omitted for the
  time being (sorry, I have no will for them now).
* Many citation tags have been omitted (sorry, again).
* Many section references  have been omitted.  The documents
  are  meant to  be browsed  in Info  format, where  one has
  accesso to various indexes (with autocompletion).
