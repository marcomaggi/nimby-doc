@section Overview of the language


Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of
feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make
additional features appear necessary.  Scheme demonstrates that a very
small number of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on
how they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient
programming language that is flexible enough to support most of the
major programming paradigms in use today.

Scheme was one of the first programming languages to incorporate
first--class procedures as in the lambda calculus, thereby proving the
usefulness of static scope rules and block structure in a dynamically
typed language.  Scheme was the first major dialect of Lisp to
distinguish procedures from lambda expressions and symbols, to use a
single lexical environment for all variables, and to evaluate the
operator position of a procedure call in the same way as an operand
position.

By relying entirely on procedure calls to express iteration, Scheme
emphasized the fact that tail--recursive procedure calls are essentially
gotos that pass arguments.  Scheme was the first widely used programming
language to embrace first--class escape procedures, from which all
previously known sequential control structures can be synthesized.  A
subsequent version of Scheme introduced the concept of exact and inexact
number objects, an extension of Common Lisp's generic arithmetic.  More
recently, Scheme became the first programming language to support
hygienic macros, which permit the syntax of a block--structured language
to be extended in a consistent and reliable manner.

@noindent
This chapter gives an overview of Scheme's semantics.  The purpose of
this overview is to explain enough about the basic concepts of the
language to facilitate understanding of the subsequent chapters of the
report, which are organized as a reference manual.  Consequently, this
overview is not a complete introduction to the language, nor is it
precise in all respects or normative in any way.

Following Algol, Scheme is a statically scoped programming language.
Each use of a variable is associated with a lexically apparent binding
of that variable.

Scheme has latent as opposed to manifest types @cite{WaiteGoos}.  Types
are associated with objects (also called values) rather than with
variables.  (Some authors refer to languages with latent types as
untyped, weakly typed or dynamically typed languages.)  Other languages
with latent types are Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, and other dialects of
Lisp.  Languages with manifest types (sometimes referred to as strongly
typed or statically typed languages) include Algol 60, C, C#, Java,
Haskell, and ML.

All objects created in the course of a Scheme computation, including
procedures and continuations, have unlimited extent.  No Scheme object
is ever destroyed.  The reason that implementations of Scheme do not
(usually!) run out of storage is that they are permitted to reclaim the
storage occupied by an object if they can prove that the object cannot
possibly matter to any future computation.  Other languages in which
most objects have unlimited extent include C#, Java, Haskell, most Lisp
dialects, ML, Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk.

Implementations of Scheme must be properly tail--recursive.  This allows
the execution of an iterative computation in constant space, even if the
iterative computation is described by a syntactically recursive
procedure.  Thus with a properly tail--recursive implementation,
iteration can be expressed using the ordinary procedure--call mechanics,
so that special iteration constructs are useful only as syntactic sugar.

Scheme was one of the first languages to support procedures as objects
in their own right.  Procedures can be created dynamically, stored in
data structures, returned as results of procedures, and so on.  Other
languages with these properties include Common Lisp, Haskell, ML, Ruby,
and Smalltalk.

One distinguishing feature of Scheme is that continuations, which in
most other languages only operate behind the scenes, also have
``first--class'' status.  First--class continuations are useful for
implementing a wide variety of advanced control constructs, including
non--local exits, backtracking, and coroutines.

In Scheme, the argument expressions of a procedure call are evaluated
before the procedure gains control, whether the procedure needs the
result of the evaluation or not.  C, C#, Common Lisp, Python, Ruby, and
Smalltalk are other languages that always evaluate argument expressions
before invoking a procedure.  This is distinct from the lazy--evaluation
semantics of Haskell, or the call--by--name semantics of Algol 60, where
an argument expression is not evaluated unless its value is needed by
the procedure.

Scheme's model of arithmetic provides a rich set of numerical types and
operations on them.  Furthermore, it distinguishes @emph{exact} and
@emph{inexact} number objects: Essentially, an exact number object
corresponds to a number exactly, and an inexact number object is the
result of a computation that involved rounding or other errors.


@c page
@node lang overview basic types
@section Basic types


@noindent
Scheme programs manipulate @emph{objects}, which are also referred to as
@emph{values}.  Scheme objects are organized into sets of values called
@emph{types}.  This section gives an overview of the fundamentally
important types of the Scheme language.  More types are described in
later chapters.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} As Scheme is latently typed, the use of the term
@emph{type} in this report differs from the use of the term in the
context of other languages, particularly those with manifest typing.
@end quotation

@subsubheading Booleans

@noindent
A boolean is a truth value, and can be either true or false.  In Scheme,
the object for ``false'' is written @false{}.  The object for ``true''
is written @true{}.  In most places where a truth value is expected,
however, any object different from @false{} counts as true.

@subsubheading Numbers

@noindent
Scheme supports a rich variety of numerical data types, including
objects representing integers of arbitrary precision, rational numbers,
complex numbers, and inexact numbers of various kinds.  @ref{lang
numbers} gives an overview of the structure of Scheme's numerical tower.

@subsubheading Characters

@noindent
Scheme characters mostly correspond to textual characters.  More
precisely, they are isomorphic to the @emph{scalar values} of the
Unicode standard.

@subsubheading Strings

@noindent
Strings are finite sequences of characters with fixed length and thus
represent arbitrary Unicode texts.

@subsubheading Symbols

@noindent
A symbol is an object representing a string, the symbol's @emph{name}.
Unlike strings, two symbols whose names are spelled the same way are
never distinguishable.  Symbols are useful for many applications; for
instance, they may be used the way enumerated values are used in other
languages.

@subsubheading Pairs and lists

@noindent
A pair is a data structure with two components.  The most common use of
pairs is to represent (singly linked) lists, where the first component
(the ``car'') represents the first element of the list, and the second
component (the ``cdr'') the rest of the list.  Scheme also has a
distinguished empty list, which is the last cdr in a chain of pairs that
form a list.

@subsubheading Vectors

@noindent
Vectors, like lists, are linear data structures representing finite
sequences of arbitrary objects.  Whereas the elements of a list are
accessed sequentially through the chain of pairs representing it, the
elements of a vector are addressed by integer indices.  Thus, vectors
are more appropriate than lists for random access to elements.

@subsubheading Procedures

@noindent
Procedures are values in Scheme.



@c page
@node lang overview expressions
@section Expressions


@noindent
The most important elements of Scheme code are @emph{expressions}.
Expressions can be @emph{evaluated}, producing a @emph{value}.
(Actually, any number of values; @ref{lang basic multiple return
values}.)  The most fundamental expressions are literal expressions:

@example
#t => #t
23 => 23
@end example

This notation means that the expression @true{} evaluates to @true{},
that is, the value for ``true'', and that the expression @code{23}
evaluates to a number object representing the number 23.

Compound expressions are formed by placing parentheses around their
subexpressions.  The first subexpression identifies an operation; the
remaining subexpressions are operands to the operation:

@example
(+ 23 42) => 65
(+ 14 (* 23 42)) => 980
@end example

In the first of these examples, @func{+} is the name of the built--in
operation for addition, and @code{23} and @code{42} are the operands.
The expression @code{(+ 23 42)} reads as ``the sum of 23 and 42''.
Compound expressions can be nested---the second example reads as ``the
sum of 14 and the product of 23 and 42''.

As these examples indicate, compound expressions in Scheme are always
written using the same prefix notation.  As a consequence, the
parentheses are needed to indicate structure.  Consequently,
``superfluous'' parentheses, which are often permissible in mathematical
notation and also in many programming languages, are not allowed in
Scheme.

As in many other languages, whitespace (including line endings) is not
significant when it separates subexpressions of an expression, and can
be used to indicate structure.


@c page
@node lang overview variables
@section Variables and binding


@noindent
Scheme allows identifiers to stand for locations containing values.
These identifiers are called variables.  In many cases, specifically
when the location's value is never modified after its creation, it is
useful to think of the variable as standing for the value directly.

@example
(let ((x 23)
      (y 42))
  (+ x y)) => 65
@end example

In this case, the expression starting with @func{let} is a binding
construct.  The parenthesized structure following the @func{let} lists
variables alongside expressions: the variable @code{x} alongside
@code{23}, and the variable @code{y} alongside @code{42}.  The
@func{let} expression binds @code{x} to 23, and @code{y} to 42.  These
bindings are available in the @emph{body} of the @func{let} expression,
@code{(+ x y)}, and only there.


@c page
@node lang overview definitions
@section Definitions


@noindent
The variables bound by a @func{let} expression are @emph{local}, because
their bindings are visible only in the @func{let}'s body.  Scheme also
allows creating top--level bindings for identifiers as follows:

@example
(define x 23)
(define y 42)
(+ x y) => 65
@end example

@noindent
(These are actually ``top--level'' in the body of a top--level program
or library; @ref{lang library}.)

The first two parenthesized structures are @emph{definitions}; they
create top--level bindings, binding @code{x} to 23 and @code{y} to 42.
Definitions are not expressions, and cannot appear in all places where
an expression can occur.  Moreover, a definition has no value.

Bindings follow the lexical structure of the program: When several
bindings with the same name exist, a variable refers to the binding that
is closest to it, starting with its occurrence in the program and going
from inside to outside, and referring to a top--level binding if no
local binding can be found along the way:

@example
(define x 23)
(define y 42)
(let ((y 43))
  (+ x y)) => 66

(let ((y 43))
  (let ((y 44))
    (+ x y))) => 67
@end example


@c page
@node lang overview forms
@section Forms


@noindent
While definitions are not expressions, compound expressions and
definitions exhibit similar syntactic structure:

@example
(define x 23)
(* x 2)
@end example

While the first line contains a definition, and the second an
expression, this distinction depends on the bindings for @func{let}
and @func{*}.  At the purely syntactical level, both are @emph{forms},
and @emph{form} is the general name for a syntactic part of a Scheme
program.  In particular, @code{23} is a @emph{subform} of the form
@code{(define x 23)}.


@c page
@node lang overview procedures
@section Procedures


@noindent
Definitions can also be used to define procedures:

@example
(define (f x)
  (+ x 42))

(f 23) => 65
@end example

A procedure is, slightly simplified, an abstraction of an expression
over objects.  In the example, the first definition defines a procedure
called @code{f}.  (Note the parentheses around @code{f x}, which
indicate that this is a procedure definition.)  The expression @code{(f
23)} is a procedure call, meaning, roughly, ``evaluate @code{(+ x 42)}
(the body of the procedure) with @code{x} bound to 23''.

As procedures are objects, they can be passed to other procedures:

@example
(define (f x)
  (+ x 42))

(define (g p x)
  (p x))

(g f 23) => 65
@end example

In this example, the body of @code{g} is evaluated with @code{p} bound
to @code{f} and @code{x} bound to 23, which is equivalent to @code{(f
23)}, which evaluates to 65.

In fact, many predefined operations of Scheme are provided not by
syntax, but by variables whose values are procedures.  The @func{+}
operation, for example, which receives special syntactic treatment in
many other languages, is just a regular identifier in Scheme, bound to a
procedure that adds number objects.  The same holds for @func{*} and
many others:

@example
(define (h op x y)
  (op x y))

(h + 23 42) => 65
(h * 23 42) => 966
@end example

Procedure definitions are not the only way to create procedures.  A
@func{lambda} expression creates a new procedure as an object, with no
need to specify a name:

@example
((lambda (x) (+ x 42)) 23) => 65
@end example

The entire expression in this example is a procedure call; @code{(lambda
(x) (+ x 42))}, evaluates to a procedure that takes a single number
object and adds 42 to it.



@c page
@node lang overview syntax
@section Procedure calls and syntactic keywords


@noindent
Whereas @code{(+ 23 42)}, @code{(f 23)}, and @code{((lambda (x) (+ x
42)) 23)} are all examples of procedure calls, @func{lambda} and
@func{let} expressions are not.  This is because @func{let}, even though
it is an identifier, is not a variable, but is instead a @emph{syntactic
keyword}.  A form that has a syntactic keyword as its first
subexpression obeys special rules determined by the keyword.  The
@func{let} identifier in a definition is also a syntactic keyword.
Hence, definitions are also not procedure calls.

The rules for the @func{lambda} keyword specify that the first subform
is a list of parameters, and the remaining subforms are the body of the
procedure.  In @func{let} expressions, the first subform is a list of
binding specifications, and the remaining subforms constitute a body of
expressions.

Procedure calls can generally be distinguished from these @emph{special
forms} by looking for a syntactic keyword in the first position of a
form: if the first position does not contain a syntactic keyword, the
expression is a procedure call.  (So--called @emph{identifier macros}
allow creating other kinds of special forms, but are comparatively
rare.)  The set of syntactic keywords of Scheme is fairly small, which
usually makes this task fairly simple.  It is possible, however, to
create new bindings for syntactic keywords; @ref{lang overview macros}
below.


@c page
@node lang overview assignment
@section Assignment


@noindent
Scheme variables bound by definitions or @func{let} or @func{lambda}
expressions are not actually bound directly to the objects specified in
the respective bindings, but to locations containing these objects.  The
contents of these locations can subsequently be modified destructively
via @emph{assignment}:

@example
(let ((x 23))
  (set! x 42)
  x) => 42
@end example

In this case, the body of the @func{let} expression consists of two
expressions which are evaluated sequentially, with the value of the
final expression becoming the value of the entire @func{let} expression.
The expression @code{(set! x 42)} is an assignment, saying ``replace the
object in the location referenced by @code{x} with 42''.  Thus, the
previous value of @code{x}, 23, is replaced by 42.


@c page
@node lang overview macros
@section Derived forms and macros


@noindent
Many of the special forms specified in this report can be translated
into more basic special forms.  For example, a @func{let} expression can
be translated into a procedure call and a @func{lambda} expression.  The
following two expressions are equivalent:

@example
(let ((x 23)
      (y 42))
  (+ x y)) => 65

((lambda (x y) (+ x y)) 23 42)    => 65
@end example

Special forms like @func{let} expressions are called @emph{derived
forms} because their semantics can be derived from that of other kinds
of forms by a syntactic transformation.  Some procedure definitions are
also derived forms.  The following two definitions are equivalent:

@example
(define (f x)
  (+ x 42))

(define f
  (lambda (x)
    (+ x 42)))
@end example

In Scheme, it is possible for a program to create its own derived forms
by binding syntactic keywords to macros:

@example
(define-syntax def
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((def f (p ...) body)
     (define (f p ...)
       body))))

(def f (x)
  (+ x 42))
@end example

The @func{define-syntax} construct specifies that a parenthesized
structure matching the pattern @code{(def f (p ...) body)}, where
@func{f}, @code{p}, and @code{body} are pattern variables, is translated
to @code{(define (f p ...) body)}.  Thus, the @code{def} form appearing
in the example gets translated to:

@example
(define (f x)
  (+ x 42))
@end example

The ability to create new syntactic keywords makes Scheme extremely
flexible and expressive, allowing many of the features built into other
languages to be derived forms in Scheme.


@c page
@node lang overview data
@section Syntactic data and datum values


@noindent
A subset of the Scheme objects is called @emph{datum values}.  These
include booleans, number objects, characters, symbols, and strings as
well as lists and vectors whose elements are data.  Each datum value may
be represented in textual form as a @emph{syntactic datum}, which can be
written out and read back in without loss of information.  A datum value
may be represented by several different syntactic data.  Moreover, each
datum value can be trivially translated to a literal expression in a
program by prepending a @code{'} (single quote) to a corresponding
syntactic datum:

@example
'23 => 23
'@true{} => @true{}
'foo => foo
'(1 2 3) => (1 2 3)
'#(1 2 3) => #(1 2 3)
@end example

The @code{'} shown in the previous examples is not needed for
representations of number objects or booleans.  The syntactic datum
@code{foo} represents a symbol with name ``foo'', and @code{'foo} is a
literal expression with that symbol as its value.  @code{(1 2 3)} is a
syntactic datum that represents a list with elements 1, 2, and 3, and
@code{'(1 2 3)} is a literal expression with this list as its value.
Likewise, @code{#(1 2 3)} is a syntactic datum that represents a vector
with elements 1, 2 and 3, and @code{'#(1 2 3)} is the corresponding
literal.

The syntactic data are a superset of the Scheme forms.  Thus, data can
be used to represent Scheme forms as data objects.  In particular,
symbols can be used to represent identifiers.

@example
'(+ 23 42) => (+ 23 42)
'(define (f x) (+ x 42))    => (define (f x) (+ x 42))
@end example

This facilitates writing programs that operate on Scheme source code, in
particular interpreters and program transformers.


@c page
@node lang overview continuations
@section Continuations


@noindent
Whenever a Scheme expression is evaluated there is a @emph{continuation}
wanting the result of the expression.  The continuation represents an
entire (default) future for the computation.  For example, informally
the continuation of @code{3} in the expression

@example
(+ 1 3)
@end example

@noindent
adds 1 to it.  Normally these ubiquitous continuations are hidden behind
the scenes and programmers do not think much about them.  On rare
occasions, however, a programmer may need to deal with continuations
explicitly.

The @func{call-with-current-continuation} procedure (@ref{baselib
control}) allows Scheme programmers to do that by creating a procedure
that reinstates the current continuation.

The @func{call-with-current-continuation} procedure accepts a procedure,
calls it immediately with an argument that is an @emph{escape
procedure}.  This escape procedure can then be called with an argument
that becomes the result of the call to
@func{call-with-current-continuation}.  That is, the escape procedure
abandons its own continuation, and reinstates the continuation of the
call to @func{call-with-current-continuation}.

In the following example, an escape procedure representing the
continuation that adds 1 to its argument is bound to @code{escape}, and
then called with 3 as an argument.  The continuation of the call to
@code{escape} is abandoned, and instead the 3 is passed to the
continuation that adds 1:

@example
(+ 1 (call-with-current-continuation
       (lambda (escape)
         (+ 2 (escape 3)))))    => 4
@end example

An escape procedure has unlimited extent: It can be called after the
continuation it captured has been invoked, and it can be called multiple
times.  This makes @func{call-with-current-continuation} significantly
more powerful than typical non--local control constructs such as
exceptions in other languages.


@c page
@node lang overview libraries
@section Libraries


@noindent
Scheme code can be organized in components called @emph{libraries}.
Each library contains definitions and expressions.  It can import
definitions from other libraries and export definitions to other
libraries.

The following library called @code{(hello)} exports a definition called
@func{hello-world}, and imports the base library (@ref{baselib}) and the
simple I/O library (see library section ``Simple I/O'').  The
@func{hello-world} export is a procedure that displays @code{Hello
World} on a separate line:

@example
(library (hello)
  (export hello-world)
  (import (rnrs base)
          (rnrs io simple))
  (define (hello-world)
    (display "Hello World")
    (newline)))
@end example


@c page
@node lang overview programs
@section Top--level programs


@noindent
A Scheme program is invoked via a @emph{top--level program}.  Like a
library, a top--level program contains imports, definitions and
expressions, and specifies an entry point for execution.  Thus a
top--level program defines, via the transitive closure of the libraries
it imports, a Scheme program.

The following top--level program obtains the first argument from the
command line via the @code{command-line} procedure from the
@rsixlibrary{programs} library (see library chapter ``Command--line
access and exit values'').  It then opens the file using
@func{open-file-input-port} (see library section ``Port IO''), yielding
a @emph{port}, i.e. a connection to the file as a data source, and calls
the @func{get-bytes-all} procedure to obtain the contents of the file as
binary data.  It then uses @func{put-bytes} to output the contents of
the file to standard output:

@example
#!r6rs
(import (rnrs base)
        (rnrs io ports)
        (rnrs programs))
(let ((p (standard-output-port)))
  (put-bytevector p
                  (call-with-port
                      (open-file-input-port
                        (cadr (command-line)))
                    get-bytevector-all))
  (close-port p))
@end example


@c page
@node lang requirements
@chapter Requirement levels


@noindent
The key words ``must'', ``must not'', ``should'', ``should not'',
``recommended'', ``may'', and ``optional'' in this report are to be
interpreted as described in @acronym{RFC} 2119.  Specifically:

@table @strong
@item must
This word means that a statement is an absolute requirement of the
specification.

@item must not
This phrase means that a statement is an absolute prohibition of the
specification.

@item should
This word, or the adjective ``recommended'', means that valid reasons
may exist in particular circumstances to ignore a statement, but that
the implications must be understood and weighed before choosing a
different course.

@item should not
This phrase, or the phrase ``not recommended'', means that valid reasons
may exist in particular circumstances when the behavior of a statement
is acceptable, but that the implications should be understood and
weighed before choosing the course described by the statement.

@item may
This word, or the adjective ``optional'', means that an item is truly
optional.
@end table

In particular, this report occasionally uses ``should'' to designate
circumstances that are outside the specification of this report, but
cannot be practically detected by an implementation; @ref{lang basic
argument checking}.  In such circumstances, a particular implementation
may allow the programmer to ignore the recommendation of the report and
even exhibit reasonable behavior.  However, as the report does not
specify the behavior, these programs may be unportable, that is, their
execution might produce different results on different implementations.

Moreover, this report occasionally uses the phrase ``not required'' to
note the absence of an absolute requirement.

@noindent
This chapter describes Scheme's model for numbers.  It is important to
distinguish between the mathematical numbers, the Scheme objects that
attempt to model them, the machine representations used to implement the
numbers, and notations used to write numbers.

In this report, the term @emph{number} refers to a mathematical number,
and the term @emph{number object} refers to a Scheme object representing
a number.  This report uses the types @emph{complex}, @emph{real},
@emph{rational}, and @emph{integer} to refer to both mathematical
numbers and number objects.  The @emph{fixnum} and @emph{flonum} types
refer to special subsets of the number objects, as determined by common
machine representations, as explained below.


@c page
@node lang numbers tower
@section Numerical tower


@noindent
Numbers may be arranged into a tower of subsets in which each level is a
subset of the level above it:

@example
number
  complex
  real
  rational
  integer
@end example

For example, 5 is an integer.  Therefore 5 is also a rational, a real,
and a complex.  The same is true of the number objects that model 5.

Number objects are organized as a corresponding tower of subtypes
defined by the predicates @code{number?}, @code{complex?}, @code{real?},
@code{rational?}, and @code{ integer?}; @ref{baselib math ops type
pred}.  Integer number objects are also called @emph{integer objects}.

There is no simple relationship between the subset that contains a
number and its representation inside a computer.  For example, the
integer 5 may have several representations.  Scheme's numerical
operations treat number objects as abstract data, as independent of
their representation as possible.  Although an implementation of Scheme
may use many different representations for numbers, this should not be
apparent to a casual programmer writing simple programs.


@c page
@node lang numbers exactness
@section Exactness


@noindent
It is useful to distinguish between number objects that are known to
correspond to a number exactly, and those number objects whose
computation involved rounding or other errors.  For example, index
operations into data structures may need to know the index exactly, as
may some operations on polynomial coefficients in a symbolic algebra
system.  On the other hand, the results of measurements are inherently
inexact, and irrational numbers may be approximated by rational and
therefore inexact approximations.  In order to catch uses of numbers
known only inexactly where exact numbers are required, Scheme explicitly
distinguishes @emph{exact} from @emph{inexact} number objects.  This
distinction is orthogonal to the dimension of type.

A number object is exact if it is the value of an exact numerical
literal or was derived from exact number objects using only exact
operations.  Exact number objects correspond to mathematical numbers in
the obvious way.

Conversely, a number object is inexact if it is the value of an inexact
numerical literal, or was derived from inexact number objects, or was
derived using inexact operations.  Thus inexactness is contagious.

Exact arithmetic is reliable in the following sense: If exact number
objects are passed to any of the arithmetic procedures described in
section ``Propagation of exactness and inexactness'', and an exact
number object is returned, then the result is mathematically correct.
This is generally not true of computations involving inexact number
objects because approximate methods such as floating--point arithmetic
may be used, but it is the duty of each implementation to make the
result as close as practical to the mathematically ideal result.


@c page
@node lang numbers fix flo
@section Fixnums and flonums


@noindent
A @emph{fixnum} is an exact integer object that lies within a certain
implementation--dependent subrange of the exact integer objects.
(Library section on ``Fixnums'' describes a library for computing with
fixnums.)  Likewise, every implementation must designate a subset of its
inexact real number objects as @emph{flonums}, and to convert certain
external representations into flonums.  (Library section on ``Flonums''
describes a library for computing with flonums.)  Note that this does
not imply that an implementation must use floating--point
representations.


@c page
@node lang numbers requirements
@section Implementation requirements


@noindent
Implementations of Scheme must support number objects for the entire
tower of subtypes given in section ``Numerical tower''.  Moreover,
implementations must support exact integer objects and exact rational
number objects of practically unlimited size and precision, and to
implement certain procedures (listed in ``Propagation of exactness and
inexactness'') so they always return exact results when given exact
arguments.  (``Practically unlimited'' means that the size and precision
of these numbers should only be limited by the size of the available
memory.)

Implementations may support only a limited range of inexact number
objects of any type, subject to the requirements of this section.  For
example, an implementation may limit the range of the inexact real
number objects (and therefore the range of inexact integer and rational
number objects) to the dynamic range of the flonum format.  Furthermore
the gaps between the inexact integer objects and rationals are likely to
be very large in such an implementation as the limits of this range are
approached.

An implementation may use floating point and other approximate
representation strategies for @emph{inexact} numbers.  This report
recommends, but does not require, that the @acronym{IEEE}
floating--point standards be followed by implementations that use
floating--point representations, and that implementations using other
representations should match or exceed the precision achievable using
these floating--point standards @cite{ieee}.

In particular, implementations that use floating--point representations
must follow these rules: A floating--point result must be represented
with at least as much precision as is used to express any of the inexact
arguments to that operation.  Potentially inexact operations such as
@func{sqrt}, when applied to exact arguments, should produce exact
answers whenever possible (for example the square root of an exact 4
ought to be an exact 2).  However, this is not required.  If, on the
other hand, an exact number object is operated upon so as to produce an
inexact result (as by @func{sqrt}), and if the result is represented in
floating point, then the most precise floating--point format available
must be used; but if the result is represented in some other way then
the representation must have at least as much precision as the most
precise floating--point format available.

It is the programmer's responsibility to avoid using inexact number
objects with magnitude or significand too large to be represented in the
implementation.

@node lang numbers inf nan
@section Infinities and NaNs


@noindent
Some Scheme implementations, specifically those that follow the
@acronym{IEEE} floating--point standards, distinguish special number
objects called, @emph{negative infinity}, and @emph{NaN}.

Positive infinity is regarded as an inexact real (but not rational)
number object that represents an indeterminate number greater than the
numbers represented by all rational number objects.  Negative infinity
is regarded as an inexact real (but not rational) number object that
represents an indeterminate number less than the numbers represented by
all rational numbers.

A NaN is regarded as an inexact real (but not rational) number object so
indeterminate that it might represent any real number, including
positive or negative infinity, and might even be greater than positive
infinity or less than negative infinity.

@noindent
Some Scheme implementations, specifically those that follow the
@acronym{IEEE} floating--point standards, distinguish between number
objects for @code{0.0} and @code{-0.0}, i.e., positive and negative
inexact zero.  This report will sometimes specify the behavior of
certain arithmetic operations on these number objects.  These
specifications are marked with ``if @code{-0.0} is distinguished'' or
``implementations that distinguish @code{-0.0}''.

@noindent
The syntax of Scheme code is organized in three levels:

@enumerate
@item
the @emph{lexical syntax} that describes how a program text is split
into a sequence of lexemes,

@item
the @emph{datum syntax}, formulated in terms of the lexical syntax, that
structures the lexeme sequence as a sequence of @emph{syntactic data},
where a syntactic datum is a recursively structured entity,

@item
the @emph{program syntax} formulated in terms of the datum syntax,
imposing further structure and assigning meaning to syntactic data.
@end enumerate

Syntactic data (also called @emph{external representations}) double as a
notation for objects, and Scheme's @rsixlibrary{io ports} library
(library section ``Port I/O'') provides the @func{get-datum} and
@func{put-datum} procedures for reading and writing syntactic data,
converting between their textual representation and the corresponding
objects.  Each syntactic datum represents a corresponding @emph{datum
value}.  A syntactic datum can be used in a program to obtain the
corresponding datum value using @code{quote} (@ref{baselib expressions
quotation}).

Scheme source code consists of syntactic data and (non--significant)
comments.  Syntactic data in Scheme source code are called @emph{forms}.
(A form nested inside another form is called a @emph{subform}.)
Consequently, Scheme's syntax has the property that any sequence of
characters that is a form is also a syntactic datum representing some
object.  This can lead to confusion, since it may not be obvious out of
context whether a given sequence of characters is intended to be a
representation of objects or the text of a program.  It is also a source
of power, since it facilitates writing programs such as interpreters or
compilers that treat programs as objects (or vice versa).

A datum value may have several different external representations.  For
example, both @code{#e28.000} and @code{#x1c} are syntactic data
representing the exact integer object 28, and the syntactic data
@code{(8 13)}, @code{( 08 13 )}, @code{(8 . (13 . ()))} all represent a
list containing the exact integer objects 8 and 13.  Syntactic data that
represent equal objects (in the sense of @func{equal?}; @ref{baselib
predicates}) are always equivalent as forms of a program.

Because of the close correspondence between syntactic data and datum
values, this report sometimes uses the term @emph{datum} for either a
syntactic datum or a datum value when the exact meaning is apparent from
the context.

An implementation must not extend the lexical or datum syntax in any
way, with one exception: it need not treat the syntax
@code{#!<identifier>}, for any <identifier> (@ref{lang lex syntax
identifiers}) that is not @code{r6rs}, as a syntax violation, and it may
use specific @code{#!}--prefixed identifiers as flags indicating that
subsequent input contains extensions to the standard lexical or datum
syntax.  The syntax @code{#!r6rs} may be used to signify that the input
afterward is written with the lexical syntax and datum syntax described
by this report.  @code{#!r6rs} is otherwise treated as a comment;
@ref{lang lex syntax whitespace and comments}.


@c page
@node lang lex notation
@section Notation


@noindent
The formal syntax for Scheme is written in an extended @acronym{BNF}.
Non--terminals are written using angle brackets.  Case is insignificant
for non--terminal names.

All spaces in the grammar are for legibility.  @meta{Empty} stands for
the empty string.

The following extensions to @acronym{BNF} are used to make the
description more concise: @arbno{@meta{thing}} means zero or more
occurrences of @meta{thing}, and @atleastone{@meta{thing}} means at
least one @meta{thing}.

Some non-terminal names refer to the Unicode scalar values of the same
name: @meta{character tabulation} (U+0009), @meta{linefeed} (U+000A),
@meta{carriage return} (U+000D), @meta{line tabulation} (U+000B),
@meta{form feed} (U+000C), @meta{space} (U+0020), @meta{next line}
(U+0085), @meta{line separator} (U+2028), and @meta{paragraph separator}
(U+2029).

@noindent
The lexical syntax determines how a character sequence is split into a
sequence of lexemes, omitting non--significant portions such as comments
and whitespace.  The character sequence is assumed to be text according
to the Unicode standard @cite{Unicode}.  Some of the lexemes, such as
identifiers, representations of number objects, strings etc., of the
lexical syntax are syntactic data in the datum syntax, and thus
represent objects.  Besides the formal account of the syntax, this
section also describes what datum values are represented by these
syntactic data.

The lexical syntax, in the description of comments, contains a forward
reference to @meta{datum}, which is described as part of the datum
syntax.  Being comments, however, these @meta{datum}s do not play a
significant role in the syntax.

Case is significant except in representations of booleans, number
objects, and in hexadecimal numbers specifying Unicode scalar values.
For example, @code{#x1A} and @code{#X1a} are equivalent.  The identifier
@code{Foo} is, however, distinct from the identifier @code{FOO}.

A @meta{hex scalar value} represents a Unicode scalar value between
@code{0} and @code{#x10FFFF}, excluding the range @code{[#D800,
#xDFFF]}.

The rules for @meta{num R}, @meta{complex R}, @meta{real R}, @meta{ureal

for R = 2, 8, 10, and 16.  There are no rules for @meta{decimal 2},
@meta{decimal 8}, and @meta{decimal 16}, which means that number
representations containing decimal points or exponents must be in
decimal radix.

@node lang lex syntax line endings
@subsection Line endings


@noindent
Line endings are significant in Scheme in single--line comments
(@ref{lang lex syntax whitespace and comments}) and within string
literals.  In Scheme source code, any of the line endings in @meta{line
ending} marks the end of a line.  Moreover, the two--character line
endings @meta{carriage return} @meta{linefeed} and @meta{carriage
return} @meta{next line} each count as a single line ending.

In a string literal, a @meta{line ending} not preceded by a @code{\}
stands for a linefeed character, which is the standard line--ending
character of Scheme.


@c page
@node lang lex syntax whitespace and comments
@subsection Whitespace and comments


@noindent
@emph{Whitespace} characters are spaces, linefeeds, carriage returns,
character tabulations, form feeds, line tabulations, and any other
character whose category is Zs, Zl, or Zp.  Whitespace is used for
improved readability and as necessary to separate lexemes from each
other.  Whitespace may occur between any two lexemes, but not within a
lexeme.  Whitespace may also occur inside a string, where it is
significant.

The lexical syntax includes several comment forms.  In all cases,
comments are invisible to Scheme, except that they act as delimiters,
so, for example, a comment cannot appear in the middle of an identifier
or representation of a number object.

A semicolon (@code{;}) indicates the start of a line comment.  The
comment continues to the end of the line on which the semicolon appears.

Another way to indicate a comment is to prefix a @meta{datum} (cf.
section ``Formal account'') with @code{#;}, possibly with
@meta{interlexeme space} before the @meta{datum}.  The comment consists
of the comment prefix @code{#;} and the @meta{datum} together.  This
notation is useful for ``commenting out'' sections of code.

Block comments may be indicated with properly nested @code{#|} and
@code{|#} pairs.

@example
#|
   The FACT procedure computes the factorial of a
   non-negative integer.
|#
(define fact
  (lambda (n)
    ;; base case
    (if (= n 0)
        #;(= n 1)
        1       ; identity of *
        (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
@end example

The lexeme @code{#!r6rs}, which signifies that the program text that
follows is written with the lexical and datum syntax described in this
report, is also otherwise treated as a comment.


@c page
@node lang lex syntax identifiers
@subsection Identifiers


@noindent
Most identifiers allowed by other programming languages are also
acceptable to Scheme.  In general, a sequence of letters, digits, and
``extended alphabetic characters'' is an identifier when it begins with
a character that cannot begin a representation of a number object.  In
addition, @code{+}, @code{-}, and @code{...} are identifiers, as is a
sequence of letters, digits, and extended alphabetic characters that
begins with the two--character sequence @code{->}.  Here are some
examples of identifiers:

@example
lambda         q                soup
list->vector   +                V17a
<=             a34kTMNs         ->-
the-word-recursion-has-many-meanings
@end example

Extended alphabetic characters may be used within identifiers as if they
were letters.  The following are extended alphabetic characters:

@example
! $ % & * + - . / : < = > ? @@ ^ _ ~
@end example

Moreover, all characters whose Unicode scalar values are greater than
127 and whose Unicode category is Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, Lo, Mn, Mc, Me, Nd,
Nl, No, Pd, Pc, Po, Sc, Sm, Sk, So, or Co can be used within
identifiers.  In addition, any character can be used within an
identifier when specified via an @meta{inline hex escape}.  For example,
the identifier @code{H\x65;llo} is the same as the identifier
@code{Hello}.
@c , and the identifier @code{\x3BB;} is the same as the
@c identifier $\lambda$.

Any identifier may be used as a variable or as a syntactic keyword
(@ref{lang basic variables keywords regions} and @ref{lang syntax
macros}) in a Scheme program.  Any identifier may also be used as a
syntactic datum, in which case it represents a @emph{symbol}
(@ref{baselib symbols}).

@end example

(The notation @code{&lexical} means that the line in question is a
lexical syntax violation.)

Case is significant in @code{#\<character>}, and in @code{#\<character
name>}, but not in the @code{<hex scalar value>} of @code{#\x<hex scalar
value>}.  A @meta{character} must be followed by a @meta{delimiter} or
by the end of the input.  This rule resolves various ambiguous cases
involving named characters, requiring, for example, the sequence of
characters @code{#\space} to be interpreted as the space character
rather than as the character @code{#\s} followed by the identifier
@code{pace}.

@emph{Note:} The @code{#\newline} notation is retained for backward
compatibility.  Its use is deprecated; @code{#\linefeed} should be used
instead.
@end quotation


@c page
@node lang lex syntax strings
@subsection Strings


@noindent
String are represented by sequences of characters enclosed within
doublequotes (@code{"}).  Within a string literal, various escape
sequences represent characters other than themselves.  Escape sequences
always start with a backslash (@code{\}):

@table @code
@item \a
alarm, U+0007
@item \b
backspace, U+0008
@item \t
character tabulation, U+0009
@item \n
linefeed, U+000A
@item \v
line tabulation, U+000B
@item \f
formfeed, U+000C
@item \r
return, U+000D
@item \"
doublequote, U+0022
@item \
backslash, U+005C
@item \<intraline whitespace><line ending> <intraline whitespace>
nothing
@item \x<hex scalar value>;
specified character (note the terminating semi--colon).
@end table

These escape sequences are case-sensitive, except that the alphabetic
digits of a @meta{hex scalar value} can be uppercase or lowercase.

Any other character in a string after a backslash is a syntax violation.
Except for a line ending, any character outside of an escape sequence
and not a doublequote stands for itself in the string literal.
@c For example the single--character string literal {\tt "$\lambda$"}
@c (doublequote, a lower case lambda, doublequote) represents the same
@c string as {\tt "\{}x03bb;"}.
A line ending that does not follow a backslash stands for a linefeed
character.

Examples:

@example
"abc"           U+0061, U+0062, U+0063
"\x41;bc"       "Abc" ; U+0041, U+0062, U+0063

formally by the @meta{number} rule in the formal grammar.  Case is not
significant in external representations of number objects.

A representation of a number object may be written in binary, octal,
decimal, or hexadecimal by the use of a radix prefix.  The radix
prefixes are @code{#b} (binary), @code{#o} (octal), @code{#d} (decimal),
and @code{#x} (hexadecimal).  With no radix prefix, a representation of
a number object is assumed to be expressed in decimal.

A representation of a number object may be specified to be either exact
or inexact by a prefix.  The prefixes are @code{#e} for exact, and
@code{#i} for inexact.  An exactness prefix may appear before or after
any radix prefix that is used.  If the representation of a number object
has no exactness prefix, the constant is inexact if it contains a
decimal point, an exponent, or a nonempty mantissa width; otherwise it
is exact.

In systems with inexact number objects of varying precisions, it may be
useful to specify the precision of a constant.  For this purpose,
representations of number objects may be written with an exponent marker
that indicates the desired precision of the inexact representation.  The
letters @code{s}, @code{f}, @code{d}, and @code{l} specify the use of
@emph{short}, @emph{single}, @emph{double}, and @emph{long} precision,
respectively.  (When fewer than four internal inexact representations
exist, the four size specifications are mapped onto those available.
For example, an implementation with two internal representations may map
short and single together and long and double together.)  In addition,
the exponent marker @code{e} specifies the default precision for the
implementation.  The default precision has at least as much precision as
@emph{double}, but implementations may wish to allow this default to be
set by the user.

@example
3.1415926535898F0
       Round to single, perhaps 3.141593
0.6L0
       Extend to long, perhaps .600000000000000
@end example

A representation of a number object with nonempty mantissa width,
@code{x|p}, represents the best binary floating--point approximation of
@emph{x} using a @emph{p}--bit significand.  For example, @code{1.1|53}
is a representation of the best approximation of 1.1 in @acronym{IEEE}
double precision.  If @emph{x} is an external representation of an
inexact real number object that contains no vertical bar, then its
numerical value should be computed as though it had a mantissa width of
53 or more.

Implementations that use binary floating--point representations of real
number objects should represent @code{x|p} using a @emph{p}--bit
significand if practical, or by a greater precision if a @emph{p}--bit
significand is not practical, or by the largest available precision if
@emph{p} or more bits of significand are not practical within the
implementation.

@quotation
@emph{Note} The precision of a significand should not be confused with
the number of bits used to represent the significand.  In the
@acronym{IEEE} floating--point standards, for example, the significand's
most significant bit is implicit in single and double precision but is
explicit in extended precision.  Whether that bit is implicit or
explicit does not affect the mathematical precision.  In implementations
that use binary floating point, the default precision can be calculated
by calling the following procedure:

@example
(define (precision)
  (do ([n 0 (+ n 1)]
       [x 1.0 (/ x 2.0)])
    ((= 1.0 (+ 1.0 x)) n)))
@end example
@end quotation

@quotation
@emph{Note} When the underlying floating--point representation is
@acronym{IEEE} double precision, the @code{|p} suffix should not always
be omitted: Denormalized floating--point numbers have diminished
precision, and therefore their external representations should carry a
@code{|p} suffix with the actual width of the significand.
@end quotation

The literals @code{+inf.0} and @code{-inf.0} represent positive and
negative infinity, respectively.  The @code{+nan.0} literal represents
the NaN that is the result of @code{(/ 0.0 0.0)}, and may represent
other NaNs as well.  The @code{-nan.0} literal also represents a NaN.

If @emph{x} is an external representation of an inexact real number
object and contains no vertical bar and no exponent marker other than
@code{e}, the inexact real number object it represents is a flonum (see
library section ``Flonums'').  Some or all of the other external
representations of inexact real number objects may also represent
flonums, but that is not required by this report.

@noindent
The following grammar describes the syntax of syntactic data in terms of
various kinds of lexemes defined in the grammar in section ``Lexical
Syntax'':

@example
<datum> -> <lexeme datum>
         | <compound datum>
<lexeme datum> -> <boolean> | <number>
         | <character> | <string> | <symbol>

<vector> -> #(<datum>*)
<bytevector> -> #vu8(<u8>*)
<u8> -> <any <number> representing an exact integer in @{0, ..., 255@}>
@end example


@c page
@node lang lex datum pairs and lists
@subsection Pairs and lists


@noindent
List and pair data, representing pairs and lists of values are
represented using parentheses or brackets.  Matching pairs of brackets
that occur in the rules of @meta{list} are equivalent to matching pairs
of parentheses.

The most general notation for Scheme pairs as syntactic data is the
``dotted'' notation @code{(<datum1> . <datum2>)} where @meta{datum1} is
the representation of the value of the car field and @meta{datum2} is
the representation of the value of the cdr field.  For example @code{(4
. 5)} is a pair whose car is 4 and whose cdr is 5.

A more streamlined notation can be used for lists: the elements of the
list are simply enclosed in parentheses and separated by spaces.  The
empty list is represented by @code{( )}.  For example,

@example
(a b c d e)
@end example

@noindent
and:

@example
(a . (b . (c . (d . (e . ())))))
@end example

@noindent
are equivalent notations for a list of symbols.

The general rule is that, if a dot is followed by an open parenthesis,
the dot, open parenthesis, and matching closing parenthesis can be
omitted in the external representation.

The sequence of characters @code{(4 . 5)} is the external representation
of a pair, not an expression that evaluates to a pair.  Similarly, the
sequence of characters @code{(+ 2 6)} is @emph{not} an external
representation of the integer 8, even though it @emph{is} an expression
(in the language of the @rsixlibrary{base} library) evaluating to the
integer 8; rather, it is a syntactic datum representing a three--element
list, the elements of which are the symbol @code{+} and the integers 2
and 6.


@c page
@node lang lex datum vectors
@subsection Vectors


@noindent
Vector data, representing vectors of objects, are represented using the
notation @code{#(<datum> ...)}.  For example, a vector of length 3
containing the number object for zero in element 0, the list @code{(2 2
2 2)} in element 1, and the string @code{"Anna"} in element 2 can be
represented as follows:

@example
#(0 (2 2 2 2) "Anna")
@end example

This is the external representation of a vector, not an expression that
evaluates to a vector.


@c page
@node lang lex datum bytevectors
@subsection Bytevectors


@noindent
Bytevector data, representing bytevectors (see library chapter
``Bytevectors''), are represented using the notation @code{#vu8(<u8>
...)}, where the @meta{u8}s represent the octets of the bytevector.  For
example, a bytevector of length 3 containing the octets 2, 24, and 123
can be represented as follows:

@example
#vu8(2 24 123)
@end example

This is the external representation of a bytevector, and also an
expression that evaluates to a bytevector.

@node lang basic programs and libraries
@section Programs and libraries


A Scheme program consists of a @emph{top--level} program together with a
set of @emph{libraries}, each of which defines a part of the program
connected to the others through explicitly specified exports and
imports.

@itemize
@item
A library consists of a set of export and import specifications and a
body, which consists of definitions, and expressions.

@item
A top--level program is similar to a library, but has no export
specifications.
@end itemize

Chapters ``Libraries'' and ``Top--level programs'' describe the syntax
and semantics of libraries and top--level programs, respectively.
Chapter ``Base library'' describes a base library that defines many of
the constructs traditionally associated with Scheme.  A separate report
@cite{R6RS-libraries} describes the various @emph{standard libraries}
provided by a Scheme system.

The division between the base library and the other standard libraries
is based on use, not on construction.  In particular, some facilities
that are typically implemented as ``primitives'' by a compiler or the
run--time system rather than in terms of other standard procedures or
syntactic forms are not part of the base library, but are defined in
separate libraries.  Examples include the fixnums and flonums libraries,
the exceptions and conditions libraries, and the libraries for records.

Within the body of a library or top--level program, an identifier may
name a kind of syntax, or it may name a location where a value can be
stored.  An identifier that names a kind of syntax is called a
@emph{keyword}, and is said to be @emph{bound} to that kind of syntax
(or, in the case of a syntactic abstraction, a @emph{transformer} that
translates the syntax into more primitive forms).  An identifier that
names a location is called a @emph{variable} and is said to be
@emph{bound} to that location.  At each point within a top--level
program or a library, a specific, fixed set of identifiers is bound.
The set of these identifiers, the set of @emph{visible bindings}, is
known as the @emph{environment} in effect at that point.

Certain forms are used to create syntactic abstractions and to bind
keywords to transformers for those new syntactic abstractions, while
other forms create new locations and bind variables to those locations.
Collectively, these forms are called @emph{binding constructs}.  Some
binding constructs take the form of @emph{definitions}, while others are
expressions.  With the exception of exported library bindings, a binding
created by a definition is visible only within the body in which the
definition appears, e.g. the body of a library, top--level program, or
@func{lambda} expression.  Exported library bindings are also visible
within the bodies of the libraries and top--level programs that import
them.

Expressions that bind variables include the @func{lambda}, @func{let},
@func{let*}, @func{letrec}, @func{letrec*}, @func{let-values}, and
@func{let*-values} forms from the base library.  Of these, @func{lambda}
is the most fundamental.  Variable definitions appearing within the body
of such an expression, or within the bodies of a library or top--level
program, are treated as a set of @func{letrec*} bindings.  In addition,
for library bodies, the variables exported from the library can be
referenced by importing libraries and top--level programs.

Expressions that bind keywords include the @func{let-syntax} and
@func{letrec-syntax} forms.  A @func{define} form is a definition that
creates a variable binding, and a @code{define-syntax} form is a
definition that creates a keyword binding.

Scheme is a statically scoped language with block structure.  To each
place in a top--level program or library body where an identifier is
bound there corresponds a @emph{region} of code within which the binding
is visible.  The region is determined by the particular binding
construct that establishes the binding; if the binding is established by
a @func{lambda} expression, for example, then its region is the entire
@func{lambda} expression.  Every mention of an identifier refers to the
binding of the identifier that establishes the innermost of the regions
containing the use.  If a use of an identifier appears in a place where
none of the surrounding expressions contains a binding for the
identifier, the use may refer to a binding established by a definition
or import at the top of the enclosing library or top--level program.  If
there is no binding for the identifier, it is said to be @emph{unbound}.


@c page
@node lang basic exceptions
@section Exceptional situations


A variety of exceptional situations are distinguished in this report,
among them violations of syntax, violations of a procedure's
specification, violations of implementation restrictions, and
exceptional situations in the environment.  When an exceptional
situation is detected by the implementation, an @emph{exception is
raised}, which means that a special procedure called the @emph{current
exception handler} is called.  A program can also raise an exception,
and override the current exception handler; see library section
``Exceptions''.

When an exception is raised, an object is provided that describes the
nature of the exceptional situation.  The report uses the condition
system described in library section ``Conditions'' to describe
exceptional situations, classifying them by condition types.

Some exceptional situations allow continuing the program if the
exception handler takes appropriate action.  The corresponding
exceptions are called @emph{continuable}.  For most of the exceptional
situations described in this report, portable programs cannot rely upon
the exception being continuable at the place where the situation was
detected.  For those exceptions, the exception handler that is invoked
by the exception should not return.  In some cases, however, continuing
is permissible, and the handler may return.  See library section
``Exceptions''.

Implementations must raise an exception when they are unable to continue
correct execution of a correct program due to some @emph{implementation
restriction}.  For example, an implementation that does not support
infinities must raise an exception with condition type
@code{&implementation-restriction} when it evaluates an expression whose
result would be an infinity.

Some possible implementation restrictions such as the lack of
representations for NaNs and infinities are anticipated by this report,
and implementations typically must raise an exception of the appropriate
condition type if they encounter such a situation.

This report uses the phrase ``an exception is raised'' synonymously with
``an exception must be raised''.  This report uses the phrase ``an
exception with condition type @var{t}'' to indicate that the object
provided with the exception is a condition object of the specified type.
The phrase ``a continuable exception is raised'' indicates an
exceptional situation that permits the exception handler to return.



@c page
@node lang basic argument checking
@section Argument checking


Many procedures specified in this report or as part of a standard
library restrict the arguments they accept.  Typically, a procedure
accepts only specific numbers and types of arguments.  Many syntactic
forms similarly restrict the values to which one or more of their
subforms can evaluate.  These restrictions imply responsibilities for
both the programmer and the implementation.  Specifically, the
programmer is responsible for ensuring that the values indeed adhere to
the restrictions described in the specification.  The implementation
must check that the restrictions in the specification are indeed met, to
the extent that it is reasonable, possible, and necessary to allow the
specified operation to complete successfully.

Note that it is not always possible for an implementation to completely
check the restrictions set forth in a specification.  For example, if an
operation is specified to accept a procedure with specific properties,
checking of these properties is undecidable in general.  Similarly, some
operations accept both lists and procedures that are called by these
operations.  Since lists can be mutated by the procedures through the
@rsixlibrary{mutable-pairs} library, an argument that is a list when the
operation starts may become a non--list during the execution of the
operation.

Also, the procedure might escape to a different continuation, preventing
the operation from performing more checks.  Requiring the operation to
check that the argument is a list after each call to such a procedure
would be impractical.  Furthermore, some operations that accept lists
only need to traverse these lists partially to perform their function;
requiring the implementation to traverse the remainder of the list to
verify that all specified restrictions have been met might violate
reasonable performance assumptions.  For these reasons, the programmer's
obligations may exceed the checking obligations of the implementation.

When an implementation detects a violation of a restriction for an
argument, it must raise an exception with condition type
@code{&assertion} in a way consistent with the safety of execution as
described in section ``Safety''.


@c page
@node lang basic syntax violations
@section Syntax violations


The subforms of a special form usually need to obey certain syntactic
restrictions.  As forms may be subject to macro expansion, which may not
terminate, the question of whether they obey the specified restrictions
is undecidable in general.

When macro expansion terminates, however, implementations must detect
violations of the syntax.  A @emph{syntax violation} is an error with
respect to the syntax of library bodies, top--level bodies, or the
``syntax'' entries in the specification of the base library or the
standard libraries.  Moreover, attempting to assign to an immutable
variable (i.e. the variables exported by a library) is also considered a
syntax violation.

If a top--level or library form in a program is not syntactically
correct, then the implementation must raise an exception with condition
type @code{&syntax}, and execution of that top--level program or library
must not be allowed to begin.


@c page
@node lang basic safety
@section Safety


The standard libraries whose exports are described by this document are
said to be @emph{safe libraries}.  Libraries and top--level programs
that import only from safe libraries are also said to be safe.

As defined by this document, the Scheme programming language is safe in
the following sense: The execution of a safe top--level program cannot
go so badly wrong as to crash or to continue to execute while behaving
in ways that are inconsistent with the semantics described in this
document, unless an exception is raised.

Violations of an implementation restriction must raise an exception with
condition type @code{&implementation-restriction}, as must all
violations and errors that would otherwise threaten system integrity in
ways that might result in execution that is inconsistent with the
semantics described in this document.

The above safety properties are guaranteed only for top--level programs
and libraries that are said to be safe.  In particular, implementations
may provide access to unsafe libraries in ways that cannot guarantee
safety.


@c page
@node lang basic boolean values
@section Boolean values


Although there is a separate boolean type, any Scheme value can be used
as a boolean value for the purpose of a conditional test.  In a
conditional test, all values count as true in such a test except for
@false{}.  This report uses the word ``true'' to refer to any Scheme
value except @false{}, and the word ``false'' to refer to @false{}.



@c page
@node lang basic multiple return values
@section Multiple return values


A Scheme expression can evaluate to an arbitrary finite number of
values.  These values are passed to the expression's continuation.

Not all continuations accept any number of values. For example, a
continuation that accepts the argument to a procedure call is guaranteed
to accept exactly one value.  The effect of passing some other number of
values to such a continuation is unspecified.  The
@func{call-with-values} procedure makes it possible to create
continuations that accept specified numbers of return values.  If the
number of return values passed to a continuation created by a call to
@func{call-with-values} is not accepted by its consumer that was passed
in that call, then an exception is raised.  A more complete description
of the number of values accepted by different continuations and the
consequences of passing an unexpected number of values is given in the
description of the @func{values} procedure.

A number of forms in the base library have sequences of expressions as
subforms that are evaluated sequentially, with the return values of all
but the last expression being discarded.  The continuations discarding
these values accept any number of values.


@c page
@node lang basic unspecified behavior
@section Unspecified behavior


If an expression is said to ``return unspecified values'', then the
expression must evaluate without raising an exception, but the values
returned depend on the implementation; this report explicitly does not
say how many or what values should be returned.  Programmers should not
rely on a specific number of return values or the specific values
themselves.



@c page
@node lang basic storage model
@section Storage model


Variables and objects such as pairs, vectors, bytevectors, strings,
hashtables, and records implicitly refer to locations or sequences of
locations.  A string, for example, contains as many locations as there
are characters in the string.  (These locations need not correspond to a
full machine word.) A new value may be stored into one of these
locations using the @func{string-set!} procedure, but the string
contains the same locations as before.

An object fetched from a location, by a variable reference or by a
procedure such as @func{car}, @func{vector-ref}, or @func{string-ref},
is equivalent in the sense of @func{eqv?} to the object last stored in
the location before the fetch.

Every location is marked to show whether it is in use.  No variable or
object ever refers to a location that is not in use.  Whenever this
report speaks of storage being allocated for a variable or object, what
is meant is that an appropriate number of locations are chosen from the
set of locations that are not in use, and the chosen locations are
marked to indicate that they are now in use before the variable or
object is made to refer to them.

It is desirable for constants (i.e. the values of literal expressions)
to reside in read-only memory.  To express this, it is convenient to
imagine that every object that refers to locations is associated with a
flag telling whether that object is mutable.  Literal constants, the
strings returned by @func{symbol->string}, records with no mutable
fields, and other values explicitly designated as immutable are
immutable objects, while all objects created by the other procedures
listed in this report are mutable.  An attempt to store a new value into
a location referred to by an immutable object should raise an exception
with condition type @code{&assertion}.



@c page
@node lang basic proper tail recursion
@section Proper tail recursion


Implementations of Scheme must be @emph{properly tail--recursive}.
Procedure calls that occur in certain syntactic contexts called
@emph{tail contexts} are @emph{tail calls}.

A Scheme implementation is properly tail--recursive if it supports an
unbounded number of active tail calls.  A call is @emph{active} if the
called procedure may still return.  Note that this includes regular
returns as well as returns through continuations captured earlier by
@func{call-with-current-continuation} that are later invoked.  In the
absence of captured continuations, calls could return at most once and
the active calls would be those that had not yet returned.  A formal
definition of proper tail recursion can be found in Clinger's paper
``Proper tail recursion and and space efficiency''.  The rules for
identifying tail calls in constructs from the @rsixlibrary{base} library
are described in section ``Tail calls and tail contexts''.



@c page
@node lang basic dynamic extent
@section Dynamic extent and the dynamic environment


@cindex Dynamic extent, definition of
@cindex Definition of dynamic extent

@cindex Dynamic environment, definition of
@cindex Definition of dynamic environment


For a procedure call, the time between when it is initiated and when it
returns is called its @emph{dynamic extent}.  In Scheme,
@func{call-with-current-continuation} allows reentering a dynamic extent
after its procedure call has returned.  Thus, the dynamic extent of a
call may not be a single, connected time period.

Some operations described in the report acquire information in addition
to their explicit arguments from the @emph{dynamic environment}.  For
example, @func{call-with-current-continuation} accesses an implicit
context established by @func{dynamic-wind}, and the @func{raise}
procedure accesses the current exception handler.

The operations that modify the dynamic environment do so dynamically,
for the dynamic extent of a call to a procedure like @func{dynamic-wind}
or @func{with-exception-handler}.  When such a call returns, the
previous dynamic environment is restored.  The dynamic environment can
be thought of as part of the dynamic extent of a call.  Consequently, it
is captured by @func{call-with-current-continuation}, and restored by
invoking the escape procedure it creates.

The chapters that describe bindings in the base library and the standard

The @emph{Category} defines the kind of binding described by the entry,
typically either ``Syntax'' or ``Procedure''.  An entry may specify
various restrictions on subforms or arguments.

@c page
@node lang entry syntax
@section Syntax entries


If @emph{category} is ``Syntax'', the entry describes a special
syntactic construct, and the template gives the syntax of the forms of
the construct.  The template is written in a notation similar to a
right--hand side of the @acronym{BNF} rules in chapter ``Lexical syntax
and datum syntax'', and describes the set of forms equivalent to the
forms matching the template as syntactic data.  Some ``Syntax'' entries
carry a suffix (@code{expand}), specifying that the syntactic keyword of
the construct is exported with level 1.  Otherwise, the syntactic
keyword is exported with level 0; @ref{lang library import export}.

Components of the form described by a template are designated by
syntactic variables, which are written using angle brackets, for
example, @meta{expression}, @meta{variable}.  Case is insignificant in
syntactic variables.  Syntactic variables stand for other forms, or
sequences of them.  A syntactic variable may refer to a non--terminal in
the grammar for syntactic data, in which case only forms matching that
non--terminal are permissible in that position.  For example,
@meta{identifier} stands for a form which must be an identifier.  Also,
@meta{expression} stands for any form which is a syntactically valid
expression.  Other non--terminals that are used in templates are defined
as part of the specification.

The notation

@example
@hyperi{thing} ...
@end example

@noindent
indicates zero or more occurrences of a @meta{thing}, and

@example
@hyperi{thing} @hyperii{thing} ...
@end example

@noindent
indicates one or more occurrences of a @meta{thing}.

It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that each component of a
form has the shape specified by a template.  Descriptions of syntax may
express other restrictions on the components of a form.  Typically, such
a restriction is formulated as a phrase of the form ``@meta{x} must be a
@dots{}''.  Again, these specify the programmer's responsibility.  It is
the implementation's responsibility to check that these restrictions are
satisfied, as long as the macro transformers involved in expanding the
form terminate.  If the implementation detects that a component does not
meet the restriction, an exception with condition type @code{&syntax}
is raised.


@c page
@node lang entry procedure
@section Procedure entries


If @emph{Category} is ``Procedure'', then the entry describes a
procedure, and the header line gives a template for a call to the
procedure.  Parameter names in the template are shown like this:
@var{parm}.  Thus the header line:

@deffn Procedure vector-ref @var{vector} @var{k}
@dots{}
@end deffn


@noindent
indicates that the built--in procedure @func{vector-ref} takes two
arguments, a vector @var{vector} and an exact non--negative integer
object @var{k} (see below).  The header lines:

@deffn Procedure make-vector @var{k}
@dots{}
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure make-vector @var{k} @var{fill}
@dots{}
@end deffn

@noindent
indicate that the @func{make-vector} procedure takes either one or two
arguments.  The parameter names are case--insensitive.

As with syntax templates, an ellipsis @dots{} at the end of a header
line, as in:

@deffn Procedure = @vari{z} @varii{z} @variii{z} ...
@dots{}
@end deffn

@noindent
indicates that the procedure takes arbitrarily many arguments of the
same type as specified for the last parameter name.  In this case,
@code{=} accepts two or more arguments that must all be complex number
objects.

A procedure that detects an argument that it is not specified to handle
must raise an exception with condition type @code{&assertion}.  Also,
the argument specifications are exhaustive: if the number of arguments
provided in a procedure call does not match any number of arguments
accepted by the procedure, an exception with condition type
@code{&assertion} must be raised.

For succinctness, the report follows the convention that if a parameter
name is also the name of a type, then the corresponding argument must be
of the named type.  For example, the header line for @func{vector-ref}
given above dictates that the first argument to @func{vector-ref} must
be a vector.  The following naming conventions imply type restrictions:

@table @var
@item obj
any object;

@item z
complex number object;

@item x
real number object;

@item y
real number object;

@item q
rational number object;

@item n
integer object;

@item k
exact non--negative integer object;

@item bool
boolean (@false{} or @true{});

@item octet
exact integer object in @{0, @dots{}, 255@};

@item byte
exact integer object in @{-128, @dots{}, 127@};

@item char
character;

@item pair
pair;

@item vector
vector;

@item string
string;

@item condition
condition;

@item bytevector
bytevector;

@item proc
procedure.
@end table

Other type restrictions are expressed through parameter--naming
conventions that are described in specific chapters.  For example,
library chapter ``Arithmetic'' uses a number of special parameter
variables for the various subsets of the numbers.

With the listed type restrictions, it is the programmer's responsibility
to ensure that the corresponding argument is of the specified type.  It
is the implementation's responsibility to check for that type.

A parameter called @var{list} means that it is the programmer's
responsibility to pass an argument that is a list.  It is the
implementation's responsibility to check that the argument is
appropriately structured for the operation to perform its function, to
the extent that this is possible and reasonable.  The implementation
must at least check that the argument is either an empty list or a pair.

Descriptions of procedures may express other restrictions on the
arguments of a procedure.  Typically, such a restriction is formulated
as a phrase of the form ``@var{x} must be a @dots{}'' (or otherwise
using the word ``must'').


@c page
@node lang entry implementation resp
@section Implementation responsibilities


In addition to the restrictions implied by naming conventions, an entry
may list additional explicit restrictions.  These explicit restrictions
usually describe both the programmer's responsibilities, who must ensure
that the subforms of a form are appropriate, or that an appropriate
argument is passed, and the implementation's responsibilities, which
must check that subform adheres to the specified restrictions (if macro
expansion terminates), or if the argument is appropriate.

A description may explicitly list the implementation's responsibilities
for some arguments or subforms in a paragraph labeled ``Implementation
responsibilities''.  In this case, the responsibilities specified for
these subforms or arguments in the rest of the description are only for
the programmer.  A paragraph describing implementation responsibility
does not affect the implementation's responsibilities for checking
subforms or arguments not mentioned in the paragraph.


@c page
@node lang entry other kinds
@section Other kinds of entries


If @emph{Category} is something other than ``Syntax'' and ``Procedure'',
then the entry describes a non--procedural value, and the
@emph{category} describes the type of that value.  The header line:

@deffn {Condition Type} {&who}
@dots{}
@end deffn

@noindent
indicates that @code{&who} is a condition type.  The header line:

@deffn {Auxiliary Syntax} unquote
@dots{}
@end deffn

@noindent
indicates that @func{unquote} is a syntax binding that may occur only as
part of specific surrounding expressions.  Any use as an independent
syntactic construct or identifier is a syntax violation.  As with
``Syntax'' entries, some ``Auxiliary Syntax'' entries carry a suffix
(@code{expand}), specifying that the syntactic keyword of the construct
is exported with level 1.


@c page
@node lang entry equivalent
@section Equivalent entries


The description of an entry occasionally states that it is @emph{the
same} as another entry.  This means that both entries are equivalent.
Specifically, it means that if both entries have the same name and are
thus exported from different libraries, the entries from both libraries
can be imported under the same name without conflict.


@c page
@node lang entry evaluation examples
@section Evaluation examples


The symbol @code{=>} used in program examples can be read ``evaluates
to''.  For example:

@example
(* 5 8)
=> 40
@end example

@noindent
means that the expression @code{(* 5 8)} evaluates to the object
@code{40}.  Or, more precisely: the expression given by the sequence of
characters @code{(* 5 8)} evaluates, in an environment that imports the
relevant library, to an object that may be represented externally by the
sequence of characters @code{40}.

The @code{=>} symbol is also used when the evaluation of an expression
causes a violation.  For example:

@example
(integer->char #xD800)
=> &assertion exception
@end example

@noindent
means that the evaluation of the expression @code{(integer->char
#xD800)} must raise an exception with condition type @code{&assertion}.

Moreover, the @code{=>} symbol is also used to explicitly say that the
value of an expression in unspecified.  For example:

@example
(eqv? "" "")
=> unspecified
@end example

Mostly, examples merely illustrate the behavior specified in the entry.
In some cases, however, they disambiguate otherwise ambiguous
specifications and are thus normative.  Note that, in some cases,
specifically in the case of inexact number objects, the return value is
only specified conditionally or approximately.  For example:

@example
(atan -inf.0)
=> -1.5707963267948965 ; approximately
@end example


@c page
@node lang entry naming conventions
@section Naming conventions


By convention, the names of procedures that store values into previously
allocated locations usually end in @code{!}.

By convention, @code{->} appears within the names of procedures that
take an object of one type and return an analogous object of another
type.  For example, @func{list->vector} takes a list and returns a
vector whose elements are the same as those of the list.

By convention, the names of predicates (procedures that always return a
boolean value) end in @code{?} when the name contains any letters;
otherwise, the predicate's name does not end with a question mark.

By convention, the components of compound names are separated by
@code{-}.  In particular, prefixes that are actual words or can be
pronounced as though they were actual words are followed by a hyphen,
except when the first character following the hyphen would be something
other than a letter, in which case the hyphen is omitted.  Short,
unpronounceable prefixes (@code{fx} and @code{fl}) are not followed by a
hyphen.

By convention, the names of condition types start with @code{&}.

@end ignore

Libraries are parts of a program that can be distributed independently.
The library system supports macro definitions within libraries, macro
exports, and distinguishes the phases in which definitions and imports
are needed.  This chapter defines the notation for libraries and a
semantics for library expansion and execution.

@c page
@node lang library form
@section Library form


A library definition must have the following form:

@example
(library @meta{library name}
  (export @meta{export spec} @dots{})
  (import @meta{import spec} @dots{})
  @meta{library body})
@end example

A library declaration contains the following elements:

@itemize
@item
The @meta{library name} specifies the name of the library (possibly with
version).

@item
The @code{export} subform specifies a list of exports, which name a
subset of the bindings defined within or imported into the library.

@item
The @code{import} subform specifies the imported bindings as a list of
import dependencies, where each dependency specifies:

@itemize -
@item
the imported library's name, and, optionally, constraints on its
version,

@item
the relevant levels, e.g. expand or run time,

@item
the subset of the library's exports to make available within the
importing library, and the local names to use within the importing
library for each of the library's exports.
@end itemize

@item
The @meta{library body} is the library body, consisting of a sequence of
definitions followed by a sequence of expressions.  The definitions may
be both for local (unexported) and exported bindings, and the
expressions are initialization expressions to be evaluated for their
effects.
@end itemize

An identifier can be imported with the same local name from two or more
libraries or for two levels from the same library only if the binding
exported by each library is the same (i.e., the binding is defined in
one library, and it arrives through the imports only by exporting and
re--exporting).  Otherwise, no identifier can be imported multiple
times, defined multiple times, or both defined and imported.  No
identifiers are visible within a library except for those explicitly
imported into the library or defined within the library.

A @meta{library name} uniquely identifies a library within an
implementation, and is globally visible in the @code{import} clauses
(see below) of all other libraries within an implementation.  A
@meta{library name} has the following form:

@example
(@hyperi{identifier} @hyperii{identifier} @dots{} @meta{version})
@end example

@noindent
where @meta{version} is empty or has the following form:

@example
(@meta{sub-version} @dots{})
@end example

Each @meta{sub-version} must represent an exact nonnegative integer
object.  An empty @meta{version} is equivalent to @code{()}.

An @meta{export spec} names a set of imported and locally defined
bindings to be exported, possibly with different external names.  An
@meta{export spec} must have one of the following forms:

@example
@meta{identifier}
(rename (@hyperi{identifier} @hyperii{identifier}) @dots{})
@end example

In an @meta{export spec}, an @meta{identifier} names a single binding
defined within or imported into the library, where the external name for
the export is the same as the name of the binding within the library.  A
@func{rename} spec exports the binding named by @hyperi{identifier} in
each @code{(@hyperi{identifier} @hyperii{identifier})} pairing, using
@hyperii{identifier} as the external name.

Each @meta{import spec} specifies a set of bindings to be imported into
the library, the levels at which they are to be available, and the local
names by which they are to be known.  An @meta{import spec} must be one
of the following:

@example
@meta{import set}
(for @meta{import set} @meta{import level} @dots{})
@end example

An @meta{import level} is one of the following:

@example
run
expand
(meta @meta{level})
@end example

@noindent
where @meta{level} represents an exact integer object.

As an @meta{import level}, @code{run} is an abbreviation for @code{(meta
0)}, and @code{expand} is an abbreviation for @code{(meta 1)}.

An @meta{import set} names a set of bindings from another library and
possibly specifies local names for the imported bindings.  It must be
one of the following:

@example
@meta{library reference}
(library @meta{library reference})
(only @meta{import set} @meta{identifier} ...)
(except @meta{import set} @meta{identifier} ...)
(prefix @meta{import set} @meta{identifier})
(rename @meta{import set} (@hyperi{identifier} @hyperii{identifier}) ...)
@end example

A @meta{library reference} identifies a library by its name and
optionally by its version.  It has one of the following forms:

@example
(@hyperi{identifier} @hyperii{identifier} ...)
(@hyperi{identifier} @hyperii{identifier} ... @meta{version reference})
@end example

A @meta{library reference} whose first @meta{identifier} is @code{for},
@code{library}, @code{only}, @code{except}, @code{prefix}, or
@code{rename} is permitted only within a @code{library} @meta{import
set}.  The @meta{import set} @code{(library @meta{library reference})}
is otherwise equivalent to @meta{library reference}.

A @meta{library reference} with no @meta{version reference} (first form
above) is equivalent to a @meta{library reference} with a @meta{version
reference} of @code{()}.

A @meta{version reference} specifies a set of @meta{version}s that it
matches.  The @meta{library reference} identifies all libraries of the
same name and whose version is matched by the @meta{version reference}.
A @meta{version reference} has the following form:

@example
(@hyperi{sub-version reference} ... @hypern{sub-version reference})
(and @meta{version reference} ...)
(or @meta{version reference} @dots{})
(not @meta{version reference})
@end example

A @meta{version reference} of the first form matches a @meta{version}
with at least @var{n} elements, whose @meta{sub-version reference}s
match the corresponding @meta{sub-version}s.  An @code{and}
@hyper{version reference} matches a version if all @meta{version
references} following the @code{and} match it.  Correspondingly, an
@code{or} @meta{version reference} matches a version if one of
@meta{version references} following the @code{or} matches it, and a
@code{not} @meta{version reference} matches a version if the
@meta{version reference} following it does not match it.

A @meta{sub-version reference} has one of the following forms:

@example
@meta{sub-version}
(>= @meta{sub-version})
(<= @meta{sub-version})
(and @meta{sub-version reference} @dots{})
(or @meta{sub-version reference} @dots{})
(not @meta{sub-version reference})
@end example

A @meta{sub-version reference} of the first form matches a
@meta{sub-version} if it is equal to it.  A @code{>=} @meta{sub-version
reference} of the first form matches a sub--version if it is greater or
equal to the @meta{sub-version} following it; analogously for @code{<=}.
An @code{and} @meta{sub-version reference} matches a sub--version if all
of the subsequent @hyper{sub-version reference}s match it.

Correspondingly, an @code{or} @meta{sub-version reference} matches a
sub--version if one of the subsequent @meta{sub-version reference}s
matches it, and a @code{not} @meta{sub-version reference} matches a
sub--version if the subsequent @meta{sub-version reference} does not
match it.

Examples:

@multitable {abcdefghilmnopqrstuvz} {abcdefghi} {match?}
@headitem version reference @tab version @tab match?
@item @code{()} @tab @code{(1)} @tab yes
@item @code{(1)} @tab @code{(1)} @tab yes
@item @code{(1)} @tab @code{(2)} @tab no
@item @code{(2 3)} @tab @code{(2)} @tab no
@item @code{(2 3)} @tab @code{(2 3)} @tab yes
@item @code{(2 3)} @tab @code{(2 3 5)} @tab yes
@item @code{(or (1 (>= 1)) (2))} @tab @code{(2)} @tab yes
@item @code{(or (1 (>= 1)) (2))} @tab @code{(1 1)} @tab yes
@item @code{(or (1 (>= 1)) (2))} @tab @code{(1 0)} @tab no
@item @code{((or 1 2 3))} @tab @code{(1)} @tab yes
@item @code{((or 1 2 3))} @tab @code{(2)} @tab yes
@item @code{((or 1 2 3))} @tab @code{(3)} @tab yes
@item @code{((or 1 2 3))} @tab @code{(4)} @tab no
@end multitable

When more than one library is identified by a library reference, the
choice of libraries is determined in some implementation-dependent
manner.

To avoid problems such as incompatible types and replicated state,
implementations should prohibit the two libraries whose library names
consist of the same sequence of identifiers but whose versions do not
match to co--exist in the same program.

By default, all of an imported library's exported bindings are made
visible within an importing library using the names given to the
bindings by the imported library.  The precise set of bindings to be
imported and the names of those bindings can be adjusted with the
@code{only}, @code{except}, @code{prefix}, and @code{ rename} forms as
described below.

@itemize
@item
An @code{only} form produces a subset of the bindings from another
@meta{import set}, including only the listed @meta{identifier}s.  The
included @meta{identifier}s must be in the original @meta{import set}.

@item
An @code{except} form produces a subset of the bindings from another
@meta{import set}, including all but the listed @meta{identifier}s.  All
of the excluded @meta{identifier}s must be in the original @meta{import
set}.

@item
A @code{prefix} form adds the @meta{identifier} prefix to each name from
another @meta{import set}.

@item
A @code{rename} form:

@example
(rename (@hyperi{identifier} @hyperii{identifier}) @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
removes the bindings for @code{@hyperi{identifier} @dots{}} to form an
intermediate @meta{import set}, then adds the bindings back for the
corresponding @code{@hyperii{identifier} @dots{}} to form the final
@meta{import set}.  Each @hyperi{identifier} must be in the original
@meta{import set}, each @hyperii{identifier} must not be in the
intermediate @meta{import set}, and the @hyperii{identifier}s must be
distinct.
@end itemize

It is a syntax violation if a constraint given above is not met.

The @meta{library body} of a @code{library} form consists of forms that
are classified as @emph{definitions} or @emph{expressions}.  Which forms
belong to which class depends on the imported libraries and the result
of expansion.  Generally, forms that are not definitions are
expressions.

A @meta{library body} is like a @meta{body} except that a @meta{library
body}s need not include any expressions.  It must have the following
form:

@example
@meta{definition} @dots{} @meta{expression} @dots{}
@end example

When @func{begin}, @func{let-syntax}, or @func{letrec-syntax} forms
occur in a top--level body prior to the first expression, they are
spliced into the body.  Some or all of the body, including portions
wrapped in @func{begin}, @func{let-syntax}, or @func{letrec-syntax}
forms, may be specified by a syntactic abstraction.

The transformer expressions and bindings are evaluated and created from
left to right, as described in chapter ``Expansion process''.  The
expressions of variable definitions are evaluated from left to right, as
if in an implicit @func{letrec*}, and the body expressions are also
evaluated from left to right after the expressions of the variable
definitions.  A fresh location is created for each exported variable and
initialized to the value of its local counterpart.  The effect of
returning twice to the continuation of the last body expression is
unspecified.

@quotation
@emph{Note:}
The names @code{library}, @code{export}, @code{import}, @code{for},
@code{run}, @code{expand}, @code{meta}, @code{import}, @code{ export},
@code{only}, @code{except}, @code{prefix}, @code{rename}, @code{and},
@code{or}, @code{not}, @code{>=}, and @code{<=} appearing in the library
syntax are part of the syntax and are not reserved, i.e., the same names
can be used for other purposes within the library or even exported from
or imported into a library with different meanings, without affecting
their use in the @code{library} form.
@end quotation

Bindings defined with a library are not visible in code outside of the
library, unless the bindings are explicitly exported from the library.
An exported macro may, however, @emph{implicitly export} an otherwise
unexported identifier defined within or imported into the library.  That
is, it may insert a reference to that identifier into the output code it
produces.

All explicitly exported variables are immutable in both the exporting
and importing libraries.  It is thus a syntax violation if an explicitly
exported variable appears on the left--hand side of a @func{set!}
expression, either in the exporting or importing libraries.

All implicitly exported variables are also immutable in both the
exporting and importing libraries.  It is thus a syntax violation if a
variable appears on the left-hand side of a @code{set!}  expression in
any code produced by an exported macro outside of the library in which
the variable is defined.  It is also a syntax violation if a reference
to an assigned variable appears in any code produced by an exported
macro outside of the library in which the variable is defined, where an
assigned variable is one that appears on the left--hand side of a
@func{set!} expression in the exporting library.

All other variables defined within a library are mutable.


@c page
@node lang library import export
@section Import and export levels


Expanding a library may require run--time information from another
library.  For example, if a macro transformer calls a procedure from
library @emph{A}, then the library @emph{A} must be instantiated before
expanding any use of the macro in library @emph{B}.  Library @emph{A}
may not be needed when library @emph{B} is eventually run as part of a
program, or it may be needed for run time of library @emph{B}, too.  The
library mechanism distinguishes these times by phases, which are
explained in this section.

Every library can be characterized by expand--time information
(minimally, its imported libraries, a list of the exported keywords, a
list of the exported variables, and code to evaluate the transformer
expressions) and run--time information (minimally, code to evaluate the
variable definition right--hand--side expressions, and code to evaluate
the body expressions).  The expand--time information must be available
to expand references to any exported binding, and the run--time
information must be available to evaluate references to any exported
variable binding.

A @emph{phase} is a time at which the expressions within a library are
evaluated.  Within a library body, top--level expressions and the
right--hand sides of @func{define} forms are evaluated at run time,
i.e. phase @emph{0}, and the right--hand sides of @func{define-syntax}
forms are evaluated at expand time, i.e. phase @emph{1}.  When
@func{define-syntax}, @func{let-syntax}, or @func{letrec-syntax} forms
appear within code evaluated at phase @emph{n}, the right--hand sides
are evaluated at phase @emph{n+1}.

These phases are relative to the phase in which the library itself is
used.  An @emph{instance} of a library corresponds to an evaluation of
its variable definitions and expressions in a particular phase relative
to another library---a process called @emph{instantiation}.  For
example, if a top--level expression in a library @emph{B} refers to a
variable export from another library @emph{A}, then it refers to the
export from an instance of @emph{A} at phase @emph{0} (relative to the
phase of @emph{B}).  But if a phase @emph{1} expression within @emph{B}
refers to the same binding from @emph{A}, then it refers to the export
from an instance of @emph{A} at phase @emph{1} (relative to the phase of
@emph{B}).

A @emph{visit} of a library corresponds to the evaluation of its syntax
definitions in a particular phase relative to another library; a process
called @emph{visiting}.  For example, if a top--level expression in a
library @emph{B} refers to a macro export from another library @emph{A},
then it refers to the export from a visit of @emph{A} at phase @emph{0}
(relative to the phase of @emph{B}), which corresponds to the evaluation
of the macro's transformer expression at phase @emph{1}.

A @emph{level} is a lexical property of an identifier that determines in
which phases it can be referenced.  The level for each identifier bound
by a definition within a library is @emph{0}; that is, the identifier
can be referenced only at phase @emph{0} within the library.  The level
for each imported binding is determined by the enclosing @code{for} form
of the @code{import} in the importing library, in addition to the levels
of the identifier in the exporting library.  Import and export levels
are combined by pairwise addition of all level combinations.  For
example, references to an imported identifier exported for levels
@emph{p_a} and @emph{p_b} and imported for levels @emph{q_a},
@emph{q_b}, and @emph{q_c} are valid at levels @emph{p_a + q_a},
@emph{p_a + q_b}, @emph{p_a + q_c}, @emph{p_b + q_a}, @emph{p_b + q_b},
and @emph{p_b + q_c}.  An @meta{import set} without an enclosing
@code{for} is equivalent to @code{(for @meta{import set} run)}, which is
the same as @code{(for @meta{import set} (meta 0))}.

The export level of an exported binding is @emph{0} for all bindings
that are defined within the exporting library.  The export levels of a
reexported binding, i.e. an export imported from another library, are
the same as the effective import levels of that binding within the
reexporting library.

For the libraries defined in the library report, the export level is
@emph{0} for nearly all bindings.  The exceptions are
@func{syntax-rules}, @func{identifier-syntax}, @code{...}, and @code{_}
from the @rsixlibrary{base} library, which are exported with level
@emph{1}, @func{set!} from the @rsixlibrary{base} library, which is
exported with levels @emph{0} and @emph{1}, and all bindings from the
composite @code{(rnrs (6))} library, which are exported with levels
@emph{0} and @emph{1}.

Macro expansion within a library can introduce a reference to an
identifier that is not explicitly imported into the library.  In that
case, the phase of the reference must match the identifier's level as
shifted by the difference between the phase of the source library (i.e.,
the library that supplied the identifier's lexical context) and the
library that encloses the reference.  For example, suppose that
expanding a library invokes a macro transformer, and the evaluation of
the macro transformer refers to an identifier that is exported from
another library (so the phase @emph{1} instance of the library is used);
suppose further that the value of the binding is a syntax object
representing an identifier with only a level @emph{n} binding; then, the
identifier must be used only at phase @emph{n+1} in the library being
expanded.  This combination of levels and phases is why negative levels
on identifiers can be useful, even though libraries exist only at
non--negative phases.

If any of a library's definitions are referenced at phase @emph{0} in
the expanded form of a program, then an instance of the referenced
library is created for phase @emph{0} before the program's definitions
and expressions are evaluated.  This rule applies transitively: if the
expanded form of one library references at phase @emph{0} an identifier
from another library, then before the referencing library is
instantiated at phase @emph{n}, the referenced library must be
instantiated at phase @emph{n}.  When an identifier is referenced at any
phase @emph{n} greater than @emph{0}, in contrast, then the defining
library is instantiated at phase @emph{n} at some unspecified time
before the reference is evaluated.  Similarly, when a macro keyword is
referenced at phase @emph{n} during the expansion of a library, then the
defining library is visited at phase @emph{n} at some unspecified time
before the reference is evaluated.

An implementation may distinguish instances/visits of a library for
different phases or to use an instance/visit at any phase as an
instance/visit at any other phase.  An implementation may further expand
each @code{library} form with distinct visits of libraries in any phase
and/or instances of libraries in phases above @emph{0}.  An
implementation may create instances/visits of more libraries at more
phases than required to satisfy references.  When an identifier appears
as an expression in a phase that is inconsistent with the identifier's
level, then an implementation may raise an exception either at expand
time or run time, or it may allow the reference.  Thus, a library whose
meaning depends on whether the instances of a library are distinguished
or shared across phases or @code{library} expansions may be unportable.

@chapter Top--level programs


@ignore
In the original document this chapter is the "programs.tex" file.
@end ignore


A ``top--level program'' specifies an entry point for defining and
running a Scheme program.  A top--level program specifies a set of
libraries to import and code to run.  Through the imported libraries,
whether directly or through the transitive closure of importing, a
top--level program defines a complete Scheme program.

@section Top--level program syntax


A top--level program is a delimited piece of text, typically a file,
that has the following form:

@example
@meta{import form} @hyper{top-level body}
@end example

An @meta{import form} has the following form:

@example
(import @meta{import spec} @dots{})
@end example

A @meta{top-level body} has the following form:

@example
@meta{top-level body form} @dots{}
@end example

A @meta{top-level body form} is either a @hyper{definition} or an
@meta{expression}.

The @meta{import form} is identical to the import clause in libraries,
and specifies a set of libraries to import.  A @meta{top-level body} is
like a @meta{library body}, except that definitions and expressions may
occur in any order.  Thus, the syntax specified by @meta{top-level body
form} refers to the result of macro expansion.

When uses of @func{begin}, @func{let-syntax}, or @func{letrec-syntax}
from the @rsixlibrary{base} library occur in a top--level body prior to
the first expression, they are spliced into the body.  Some or all of
the body, including portions wrapped in @func{begin}, @func{let-syntax},
or @func{letrec-syntax} forms, may be specified by a syntactic
abstraction.



@c page
@node lang programs semantics
@section Top--level program semantics


A top--level program is executed by treating the program similarly to a
library, and evaluating its definitions and expressions.  The semantics
of a top--level body may be roughly explained by a simple translation
into a library body: Each @meta{expression} that appears before a
definition in the top-level body is converted into a dummy definition

@example
(define @meta{variable}
  (begin @meta{expression} @meta{unspecified}))
@end example

where @meta{variable} is a fresh identifier and @meta{unspecified} is a
side--effect--free expression returning an unspecified value.  (It is
generally impossible to determine which forms are definitions and
expressions without concurrently expanding the body, so the actual
translation is somewhat more complicated.)

On platforms that support it, a top--level program may access its
command line by calling the @func{command-line} procedure (see library
section ``Command--line access and exit values'').

@chapter Primitive syntax


@ignore

@end ignore

After the @code{import} form within a @code{library} form or a
top--level program, the forms that constitute the body of the library or
the top--level program depend on the libraries that are imported.  In
particular, imported syntactic keywords determine the available
syntactic abstractions and whether each form is a definition or
expression.  A few form types are always available independent of
imported libraries, however, including constant literals, variable
references, procedure calls, and macro uses.

@end menu


@c page
@node lang syntax primitive
@section Primitive expression types


The entries in this section all describe expressions, which may occur in
the place of @meta{expression} syntactic variables.


@subsubheading Constant literals

@deffn Syntax @meta{number}
@deffnx Syntax @meta{boolean}
@deffnx Syntax @meta{character}
@deffnx Syntax @meta{string}
@deffnx Syntax @meta{bytevector}
An expression consisting of a representation of a number object, a
boolean, a character, a string, or a bytevector, evaluates ``to
itself''.

@example
145932          =>  145932
#t              =>  #t
"abc"           =>  "abc"
#vu8(2 24 123)  => #vu8(2 24 123)
@end example

As noted in section ``Storage model'', the value of a literal expression
is immutable.
@end deffn

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Variable references

@deffn Syntax @meta{variable}
An expression consisting of a variable is a variable reference if it is
not a macro use (see below).  The value of the variable reference is the
value stored in the location to which the variable is bound.  It is a
syntax violation to reference an unbound variable.

The following example examples assumes the base library has been
imported:

@example
(define x 28)
x   =>  28
@end example
@end deffn

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Procedure calls

@deffn Syntax (@meta{operator} @hyperi{operand} @dots{})
A procedure call consists of expressions for the procedure to be called
and the arguments to be passed to it, with enclosing parentheses.  A
form in an expression context is a procedure call if @meta{operator} is
not an identifier bound as a syntactic keyword.

When a procedure call is evaluated, the operator and operand expressions
are evaluated (in an unspecified order) and the resulting procedure is
passed the resulting arguments.

The following examples assume the @rsixlibrary{base} library has been
imported:

@example
(+ 3 4)                 =>  7
((if #f + *) 3 4)       =>  12
@end example

If the value of @meta{operator} is not a procedure, an exception with
condition type @code{&assertion} is raised.  Also, if @meta{operator}
does not accept as many arguments as there are @meta{operand}s, an
exception with condition type @code{&assertion} is raised.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} In contrast to other dialects of Lisp, the order of
evaluation is unspecified, and the operator expression and the operand
expressions are always evaluated with the same evaluation rules.

Although the order of evaluation is otherwise unspecified, the effect of
any concurrent evaluation of the operator and operand expressions is
constrained to be consistent with some sequential order of evaluation.
The order of evaluation may be chosen differently for each procedure
call.
@end quotation

@quotation
@emph{Note:} In many dialects of Lisp, the form @code{()} is a
legitimate expression.  In Scheme, expressions written as list/pair
forms must have at least one subexpression, so @code{()} is not a
syntactically valid expression.
@end quotation
@end deffn

@node lang syntax macros
@section Macros


@cindex Transformer, definition of
@cindex Definition of transformer
@cindex Macro transformer, definition of
@cindex Definition of macro transformer


Libraries and top--level programs can define and use new kinds of
derived expressions and definitions called @emph{syntactic abstractions}
or @emph{macros}.  A syntactic abstraction is created by binding a
keyword to a @emph{macro transformer} or, simply, @emph{transformer}.

The transformer determines how a use of the macro (called a @emph{macro
use}) is transcribed into a more primitive form.

Most macro uses have the form:

@example
(@meta{keyword} @meta{datum} @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
where @meta{keyword} is an identifier that uniquely determines the kind
of form.  This identifier is called the @emph{syntactic keyword}, or
simply @emph{keyword}.  The number of @meta{datum}s and the syntax of
each depends on the syntactic abstraction.

Macro uses can also take the form of improper lists, singleton
identifiers, or @func{set!} forms, where the second subform of the
@func{set!} is the keyword:

@example
(@meta{keyword} @meta{datum} @dots{} . @meta{datum})
@meta{keyword}
(set! @meta{keyword} @meta{datum})
@end example

The @func{define-syntax}, @func{let-syntax} and @func{letrec-syntax}
forms create bindings for keywords, associate them with macro
transformers, and control the scope within which they are visible.

The @func{syntax-rules} and @func{identifier-syntax} forms create
transformers via a pattern language.  Moreover, the @func{syntax-case}
form allows creating transformers via arbitrary Scheme code.

Keywords occupy the same name space as variables.  That is, within the
same scope, an identifier can be bound as a variable or keyword, or
neither, but not both, and local bindings of either kind may shadow
other bindings of either kind.

Macros defined using @func{syntax-rules} and @func{identifier-syntax}
are ``hygienic'' and ``referentially transparent'' and thus preserve
Scheme's lexical scoping.

@itemize
@item
If a macro transformer inserts a binding for an identifier (variable or
keyword) not appearing in the macro use, the identifier is in effect
renamed throughout its scope to avoid conflicts with other identifiers.

@item
If a macro transformer inserts a free reference to an identifier, the
reference refers to the binding that was visible where the transformer
was specified, regardless of any local bindings that may surround the
use of the macro.
@end itemize

Macros defined using the @func{syntax-case} facility are also hygienic
unless @func{datum->syntax} is used.



@c page
@node lang expansion
@chapter Expansion process


@ignore
In the original document this chapter is the file "expansion.tex".
@end ignore


Macro uses are expanded into @emph{core forms} at the start of
evaluation (before compilation or interpretation) by a syntax
@emph{expander}.  The set of core forms is implementation--dependent, as
is the representation of these forms in the expander's output.  If the
expander encounters a syntactic abstraction, it invokes the associated
transformer to expand the syntactic abstraction, then repeats the
expansion process for the form returned by the transformer.  If the
expander encounters a core form, it recursively processes its subforms
that are in expression or definition context, if any, and reconstructs
the form from the expanded subforms.  Information about identifier
bindings is maintained during expansion to enforce lexical scoping for
variables and keywords.

To handle definitions, the expander processes the initial forms in a
@meta{body} or @meta{library body} from left to right.  How the expander
processes each form encountered depends upon the kind of form.

@table @asis
@item macro use
The expander invokes the associated transformer to transform the macro
use, then recursively performs whichever of these actions are
appropriate for the resulting form.

@item @func{define-syntax} form
The expander expands and evaluates the right--hand--side expression and
binds the keyword to the resulting transformer.

@item @func{define} form
The expander records the fact that the defined identifier is a variable
but defers expansion of the right--hand--side expression until after all
of the definitions have been processed.

@item @func{begin} form
The expander splices the subforms into the list of body forms it is
processing.

@item @func{let-syntax} or @func{letrec-syntax} form
The expander splices the inner body forms into the list of (outer) body
forms it is processing, arranging for the keywords bound by the
@func{let-syntax} and @func{letrec-syntax} to be visible only in the
inner body forms.

@item expression, i.e., nondefinition
The expander completes the expansion of the deferred right--hand--side
expressions and the current and remaining expressions in the body, and
then creates the equivalent of a @func{letrec*} form from the defined
variables, expanded right--hand--side expressions, and expanded body
expressions.
@end table

For the right--hand side of the definition of a variable, expansion is
deferred until after all of the definitions have been seen.
Consequently, each keyword and variable reference within the right--hand
side resolves to the local binding, if any.

A definition in the sequence of forms must not define any identifier
whose binding is used to determine the meaning of the undeferred
portions of the definition or any definition that precedes it in the
sequence of forms.  For example, the bodies of the following expressions
violate this restriction.

@example
(let ()
  (define define 17)
  (list define))

(let-syntax ([def0 (syntax-rules ()
                     [(_ x) (define x 0)])])
  (let ([z 3])
    (def0 z)
    (define def0 list)
    (list z)))

(let ()
  (define-syntax foo
    (lambda (e)
      (+ 1 2)))
  (define + 2)
  (foo))%
@end example

The following do not violate the restriction.

@example
(let ([x 5])
  (define lambda list)
  (lambda x x))         =>  (5 5)

(let-syntax ([def0 (syntax-rules ()
                     [(_ x) (define x 0)])])
  (let ([z 3])
    (define def0 list)
    (def0 z)
    (list z)))          =>  (3)

(let ()
  (define-syntax foo
    (lambda (e)
      (let ([+ -]) (+ 1 2))))
  (define + 2)
  (foo))                =>  -1%
@end example

The implementation should treat a violation of the restriction as a
syntax violation.

Note that this algorithm does not directly reprocess any form.  It
requires a single left--to--right pass over the definitions followed by
a single pass (in any order) over the body expressions and deferred
right--hand sides.

Example:

@example
(lambda (x)
  (define-syntax defun
    (syntax-rules ()
      [(_ x a e) (define x (lambda a e))]))
  (defun even? (n) (or (= n 0) (odd? (- n 1))))
  (define-syntax odd?
    (syntax-rules () [(_ n) (not (even? n))]))
  (odd? (if (odd? x) (* x x) x)))
@end example

In the example:

@enumerate
@item
The definition of @func{defun} is encountered first, and the keyword
@func{defun} is associated with the transformer resulting from the
expansion and evaluation of the corresponding right--hand side.

@item
A use of @func{defun} is encountered next and expands into a
@func{define} form.  Expansion of the right--hand side of this
@func{define} form is deferred.

@item
The definition of @func{odd?} is next and results in the association of
the keyword @func{odd?} with the transformer resulting from expanding
and evaluating the corresponding right--hand side.

@item
A use of @func{odd?}  appears next and is expanded; the resulting call
to @func{not} is recognized as an expression because @func{not} is bound
as a variable.

@item
At this point, the expander completes the expansion of the current
expression (the call to @func{not}) and the deferred right--hand side of
the @func{even?}  definition; the uses of @func{odd?} appearing in these
expressions are expanded using the transformer associated with the
keyword @func{odd?}.

@item
The final output is the equivalent of:

@example
(lambda (x)
  (letrec* ([even?
              (lambda (n)
                (or (= n 0)
                    (not (even? (- n 1)))))])
    (not (even? (if (not (even? x)) (* x x) x)))))
@end example

@noindent
although the structure of the output is implementation-dependent.
@end enumerate

Because definitions and expressions can be interleaved in a
@meta{top-level body}, the expander's processing of a @meta{top-level
body} is somewhat more complicated.  It behaves as described above for a
@meta{body} or @meta{library body} with the following exceptions:

@itemize
@item
When the expander finds a nondefinition, it defers its expansion and
continues scanning for definitions.

@item
Once it reaches the end of the set of forms, it processes the deferred
right--hand--side and body expressions, then generates the equivalent of
a @func{letrec*} form from the defined variables, expanded
right--hand--side expressions, and expanded body expressions.

@item
For each body expression @meta{expression} that appears before a
variable definition in the body, a dummy binding is created at the
corresponding place within the set of @func{letrec*} bindings, with a
fresh temporary variable on the left--hand side and the equivalent of:

@example
(begin @meta{expression} @meta{unspecified})
@end example

@noindent
where @meta{unspecified} is a side--effect--free expression returning an
unspecified value, on the right--hand side, so that left--to--right
evaluation order is preserved.  The @func{begin} wrapper allows
@meta{expression} to evaluate to an arbitrary number of values.

@chapter Sample definitions for derived forms


@ignore
In the original document this appendix is the file "derived.tex".
@end ignore


This appendix contains sample definitions for some of the keywords
described in this report in terms of simpler forms:


@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading @func{cond}

The @func{cond} keyword could be defined in terms of @func{if},
@func{let} and @func{begin} using @func{syntax-rules} as follows:

@example
(define-syntax cond
  (syntax-rules (else =>)
    ((cond (else result1 result2 ...))
     (begin result1 result2 ...))
    ((cond (test => result))
     (let ((temp test))
       (if temp (result temp))))
    ((cond (test => result) clause1 clause2 ...)
     (let ((temp test))
       (if temp
           (result temp)
           (cond clause1 clause2 ...))))
    ((cond (test)) test)
    ((cond (test) clause1 clause2 ...)
     (let ((temp test))
       (if temp
           temp
           (cond clause1 clause2 ...))))
    ((cond (test result1 result2 ...))
     (if test (begin result1 result2 ...)))
    ((cond (test result1 result2 ...)
           clause1 clause2 ...)
     (if test
         (begin result1 result2 ...)
         (cond clause1 clause2 ...)))))
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading @func{case}

The @func{case} keyword could be defined in terms of @func{let},
@func{cond}, and @func{memv} using @code{syntax-rules} as follows:

@example
(define-syntax case
  (syntax-rules (else)
    ((case expr0
       ((key ...) res1 res2 ...)
       ...
       (else else-res1 else-res2 ...))
     (let ((tmp expr0))
       (cond
         ((memv tmp '(key ...)) res1 res2 ...)
         ...
         (else else-res1 else-res2 ...))))
    ((case expr0
       ((keya ...) res1a res2a ...)
       ((keyb ...) res1b res2b ...)
       ...)
     (let ((tmp expr0))
       (cond
         ((memv tmp '(keya ...)) res1a res2a ...)
         ((memv tmp '(keyb ...)) res1b res2b ...)
         ...)))))
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading @func{let*}

The @func{let*} keyword could be defined in terms of @func{let} using
@func{syntax-rules} as follows:

@example
(define-syntax let*
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((let* () body1 body2 ...)
     (let () body1 body2 ...))
    ((let* ((name1 expr1) (name2 expr2) ...)
       body1 body2 ...)
     (let ((name1 expr1))
       (let* ((name2 expr2) ...)
         body1 body2 ...)))))
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading @func{letrec}

The @func{letrec} keyword could be defined approximately in terms of
@func{let} and @func{set!} using @func{syntax-rules}, using a helper to
generate the temporary variables needed to hold the values before the
assignments are made, as follows:

@example
(define-syntax letrec
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((letrec () body1 body2 ...)
     (let () body1 body2 ...))
    ((letrec ((var init) ...) body1 body2 ...)
     (letrec-helper
       (var ...)
       ()
       ((var init) ...)
       body1 body2 ...))))

(define-syntax letrec-helper
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((letrec-helper
       ()
       (temp ...)
       ((var init) ...)
       body1 body2 ...)
     (let ((var <undefined>) ...)
       (let ((temp init) ...)
         (set! var temp)
         ...)
       (let () body1 body2 ...)))
    ((letrec-helper
       (x y ...)
       (temp ...)
       ((var init) ...)
       body1 body2 ...)
     (letrec-helper
       (y ...)
       (newtemp temp ...)
       ((var init) ...)
       body1 body2 ...))))
@end example

The syntax @code{<undefined>} represents an expression that returns
something that, when stored in a location, causes an exception with
condition type @code{&assertion} to be raised if an attempt to read from
or write to the location occurs before the assignments generated by the
@func{letrec} transformation take place.  (No such expression is defined
in Scheme.)

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading @func{letrec*}

The @func{letrec*} keyword could be defined approximately in terms of
@func{let} and @func{set!} using @func{syntax-rules} as follows:

@example
(define-syntax letrec*
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((letrec* ((var1 init1) ...) body1 body2 ...)
     (let ((var1 <undefined>) ...)
       (set! var1 init1)
       ...
       (let () body1 body2 ...)))))
@end example

The syntax @code{<undefined>} is as in the definition of @func{letrec}

@subsubheading @func{let-values}

The following definition of @func{let-values} using @func{syntax-rules}
employs a pair of helpers to create temporary names for the formals.

@example
(define-syntax let-values
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((let-values (binding ...) body1 body2 ...)
     (let-values-helper1
       ()
       (binding ...)
       body1 body2 ...))))

(define-syntax let-values-helper1
  ;; map over the bindings
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((let-values
       ((id temp) ...)
       ()
       body1 body2 ...)
     (let ((id temp) ...) body1 body2 ...))
    ((let-values
       assocs
       ((formals1 expr1) (formals2 expr2) ...)
       body1 body2 ...)
     (let-values-helper2
       formals1
       ()
       expr1
       assocs
       ((formals2 expr2) ...)
       body1 body2 ...))))

(define-syntax let-values-helper2
  ;; create temporaries for the formals
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((let-values-helper2
       ()
       temp-formals
       expr1
       assocs
       bindings
       body1 body2 ...)
     (call-with-values
       (lambda () expr1)
       (lambda temp-formals
         (let-values-helper1
           assocs
           bindings
           body1 body2 ...))))
    ((let-values-helper2
       (first . rest)
       (temp ...)
       expr1
       (assoc ...)
       bindings
       body1 body2 ...)
     (let-values-helper2
       rest
       (temp ... newtemp)
       expr1
       (assoc ... (first newtemp))
       bindings
       body1 body2 ...))
    ((let-values-helper2
       rest-formal
       (temp ...)
       expr1
       (assoc ...)
       bindings
       body1 body2 ...)
     (call-with-values
       (lambda () expr1)
       (lambda (temp ... . newtemp)
         (let-values-helper1
           (assoc ... (rest-formal newtemp))
           bindings
           body1 body2 ...))))))
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading @func{let*-values}

The following macro defines @func{let*-values} in terms of @func{let}
and @func{let-values} using @func{syntax-rules}:

@example
(define-syntax let*-values
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((let*-values () body1 body2 ...)
     (let () body1 body2 ...))
    ((let*-values (binding1 binding2 ...)
       body1 body2 ...)
     (let-values (binding1)
       (let*-values (binding2 ...)
         body1 body2 ...)))))
@end example


@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading @func{let}

The @func{let} keyword could be defined in terms of @func{lambda} and
@func{letrec} using @func{syntax-rules} as follows:

@example
(define-syntax @func{let}
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((let ((name val) ...) body1 body2 ...)
     ((lambda (name ...) body1 body2 ...)
      val ...))
    ((let tag ((name val) ...) body1 body2 ...)
     ((letrec ((tag (lambda (name ...)
                      body1 body2 ...)))
        tag)
      val ...))))

@section Base types


No object satisfies more than one of the following predicates:

@example
boolean?          pair?
symbol?           number?
char?             string?
vector?           procedure?
null?
@end example

These predicates define the base types @emph{boolean}, @emph{pair},
@emph{symbol}, @emph{number}, @emph{char} (or @emph{character}),
@emph{string}, @emph{vector}, and @emph{procedure}.  Moreover, the empty
list is a special object of its own type.

Note that, although there is a separate boolean type, any Scheme value
can be used as a boolean value for the purpose of a conditional test.



@c page
@node baselib definitions
@section Definitions


Definitions may appear within a @meta{top-level body}, at the top of a
@meta{library body}, or at the top of a @meta{body}.

A @meta{definition} may be a variable definition or keyword definition.
Macro uses that expand into definitions or groups of definitions
(packaged in a @func{begin}, @func{let-syntax}, or @func{letrec-syntax}
form) may also appear wherever other definitions may appear.

@end menu



@c page
@node baselib definitions variables
@subsection Variables definitions


The @func{define} form described in this section is a @meta{definition}
used to create variable bindings and may appear anywhere other
definitions may appear.


@deffn Syntax define @meta{variable} @hyper{expression}
@deffnx Syntax define @meta{variable}
@deffnx Syntax define @meta{variable} @hyper{formals}) @hyper{body}
@deffnx Syntax define (@meta{variable} . @hyper{formal}) @hyper{body})
The first from of @func{define} binds @meta{variable} to a new location
before assigning the value of @meta{expression} to it.

@example
(define add3
  (lambda (x) (+ x 3)))
(add3 3)                            =>  6
(define first car)
(first '(1 2))                      =>  1
@end example

The continuation of @meta{expression} should not be invoked more than
once.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} Implementations should detect
that the continuation of @meta{expression} is invoked more than once.
If the implementation detects this, it must raise an exception with
condition type @code{&assertion}.

The second form of @func{define} is equivalent to:

@example
(define @meta{variable} @hyper{unspecified})
@end example

@noindent
where @meta{unspecified} is a side--effect--free expression returning an
unspecified value.

In the third form of @func{define}, @meta{formals} must be either a
sequence of zero or more variables, or a sequence of one or more
variables followed by a dot @code{.} and another variable (as in a
lambda expression).  This form is equivalent to:

@example
(define @meta{variable}
  (lambda (@meta{formals}) @hyper{body}))
@end example

In the fourth form of @func{define}, @meta{formal} must be a single
variable.  This form is equivalent to:

@example
(define @meta{variable}
  (lambda @meta{formal} @hyper{body}))
@end example
@end deffn



@c page
@node baselib definitions syntax
@subsection Syntax definitions


The @code{define-syntax} form described in this section is a
@meta{definition} used to create keyword bindings and may appear
anywhere other definitions may appear.


@deffn Syntax define-syntax @meta{keyword} @hyper{expression}
Binds @meta{keyword} to the value of @meta{expression}, which must
evaluate, at macro--expansion time, to a transformer.  Macro
transformers can be created using the @func{syntax-rules} and
@func{identifier-syntax} forms.

Keyword bindings established by @func{define-syntax} are visible
throughout the body in which they appear, except where shadowed by other
bindings, and nowhere else, just like variable bindings established by
@func{define}.  All bindings established by a set of definitions,
whether keyword or variable definitions, are visible within the
definitions themselves.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation should
detect if the value of @meta{expression} cannot possibly be a
transformer.

Example:

@example
(let ()
  (define even?
    (lambda (x)
      (or (= x 0) (odd? (- x 1)))))
  (define-syntax odd?
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((odd?  x) (not (even? x)))))
  (even? 10))
=> #t
@end example

An implication of the left--to--right processing order is that one
definition can affect whether a subsequent form is also a definition.

Example:

@example
(let ()
  (define-syntax bind-to-zero
    (syntax-rules ()
      ((bind-to-zero id) (define id 0))))
  (bind-to-zero x)
  x)
=> 0
@end example

The behavior is unaffected by any binding for @func{bind-to-zero} that
might appear outside of the @func{let} expression.
@end deffn



@c page
@node baselib bodies
@section Bodies


The @meta{body} of a @func{lambda}, @func{let}, @func{let*},
@func{let-values}, @func{let*-values}, @func{letrec}, or @func{letrec*}
expression, or that of a definition with a body consists of zero or more
definitions followed by one or more expressions.

@example
@meta{definition} @dots{} @hyperi{expression} @hyperii{expression} @dots{}
@end example

Each identifier defined by a definition is local to the @meta{body}.
That is, the identifier is bound, and the region of the binding is the
entire @meta{body}.

Example:

@example
(let ((x 5))
  (define foo (lambda (y) (bar x y)))
  (define bar (lambda (a b) (+ (* a b) a)))
  (foo (+ x 3)))
=>  45
@end example

When @func{begin}, @func{let-syntax}, or @func{letrec-syntax} forms
occur in a body prior to the first expression, they are spliced into the
body.  Some or all of the body, including portions wrapped in
@func{begin}, @func{let-syntax}, or @func{letrec-syntax} forms, may be
specified by a macro use.

An expanded @meta{body} containing variable definitions can always be
converted into an equivalent @func{letrec*} expression.  For example,
the @func{let} expression in the above example is equivalent to

@example
(let ((x 5))
  (letrec* ((foo (lambda (y) (bar x y)))
            (bar (lambda (a b) (+ (* a b) a))))
    (foo (+ x 3))))
@end example

@c page
@node baselib expressions quotation
@subsection Quotation


@deffn Syntax quote @meta{datum}
@meta{Datum} should be a syntactic datum.  @code{(quote @meta{datum})}
evaluates to the datum value represented by @meta{datum}.  This notation
is used to include constants.

@example
(quote a)               =>  a
(quote #(a b c))        =>  #(a b c)
(quote (+ 1 2))         =>  (+ 1 2)
@end example

@code{(quote @meta{datum})} may be abbreviated as @code{'@meta{datum}}:

@example
'"abc"               =>  "abc"
'145932              =>  145932
'a                   =>  a
'#(a b c)            =>  #(a b c)
'()                  =>  ()
'(+ 1 2)             =>  (+ 1 2)
'(quote a)           =>  (quote a)
''a                  =>  (quote a)
@end example

Constants are immutable.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Different constants that are the value of a @func{quote}
expression may share the same locations.
@end quotation
@end deffn



@c page
@node baselib expressions procedures
@subsection Procedures


@deffn Syntax lambda @meta{formals} @hyper{body}
@meta{formals} must be a formal parameter list as described below, and
@meta{body} must be as described in @ref{baselib bodies}.

A @func{lambda} evaluates to a procedure.  The environment in effect
when the @func{lambda} is evaluated is remembered as part of the
procedure.  When the procedure is later called with some arguments, the
environment in which the @func{lambda} was evaluated is extended by
binding the variables in the parameter list to fresh locations, and the
resulting argument values are stored in those locations.  Then, the
expressions in the body of the @func{lambda} (which may contain
definitions and thus represent a @func{letrec*} form) are evaluated
sequentially in the extended environment.  The results of the last
expression in the body are returned as the results of the procedure
call.

@example
(lambda (x) (+ x x))      =>  a procedure
((lambda (x) (+ x x)) 4)  =>  8

((lambda (x)
   (define (p y)
     (+ y 1))
   (+ (p x) x))
 5) => 11

(define reverse-subtract
  (lambda (x y) (- y x)))
(reverse-subtract 7 10)         =>  3

(define add4
  (let ((x 4))
    (lambda (y) (+ x y))))
(add4 6)                        =>  10
@end example

@meta{formals} must have one of the following forms:

@table @code
@item (@hyperi{variable} @dots{})
The procedure takes a fixed number of arguments; when the procedure is
called, the arguments are stored in the bindings of the corresponding
variables.

@item @meta{variable}
The procedure takes any number of arguments; when the procedure is
called, the sequence of arguments is converted into a newly allocated
list, and the list is stored in the binding of the @meta{variable}.

@item (@hyperi{variable} @dots{} @meta{variableN} . @meta{variableN+1})
If a period @code{.} precedes the last variable, then the procedure
takes @var{n} or more arguments, where @var{n} is the number of
parameters before the period (there must be at least one).  The value
stored in the binding of the last variable is a newly allocated list of
the arguments left over after all the other arguments have been matched
up against the other parameters.

@example
((lambda x x) 3 4 5 6)          =>  (3 4 5 6)
((lambda (x y . z) z)
 3 4 5 6)                       =>  (5 6)
@end example
@end table

Any @meta{variable} must not appear more than once in @meta{formals}.
@end deffn



@c page
@node baselib expressions conditionals
@subsection Conditionals


@deffn Syntax if @meta{test} @meta{consequent} @meta{alternate}
@deffnx Syntax if @meta{test} @meta{consequent}
@meta{test}, @meta{consequent}, and @meta{alternate} must be
expressions.

An @func{if} expression is evaluated as follows: first, @meta{test} is
evaluated.  If it yields a true value, then @meta{consequent} is
evaluated and its values are returned.  Otherwise @meta{alternate} is
evaluated and its values are returned.  If @meta{test} yields @false{}
and no @meta{alternate} is specified, then the result of the expression
is unspecified.

@example
(if (> 3 2) 'yes 'no)           => yes
(if (> 2 3) 'yes 'no)           => no
(if (> 3 2)
    (- 3 2)
    (+ 3 2))                    => 1
(if #f #f)                      => unspecified
@end example

The @meta{consequent} and @meta{alternate} expressions are in tail
context if the @func{if} expression itself is.
@end deffn



@c page
@node baselib expressions assignments
@subsection Assignments


@deffn Syntax set! @meta{variable} @meta{expression}
@meta{expression} is evaluated, and the resulting value is stored in the
location to which @meta{variable} is bound.  @meta{variable} must be
bound either in some region expression or at the top level.  The result
of the @func{set!} expression is unspecified.

@example
(let ((x 2))
  (+ x 1)
  (set! x 4)
  (+ x 1)) =>  5
@end example

It is a syntax violation if @meta{variable} refers to an immutable
binding.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} The identifier @func{set!} is exported with level @emph{1}
as well.
@end quotation
@end deffn



@c page
@node baselib expressions derived cond
@subsection Derived conditionals


@deffn Syntax cond @hyperi{cond clause} @hyperii{cond clause} @dots{}
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} {=>}
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} else
Each @meta{cond clause} must be of the form:

@example
(@meta{test} @hyperi{expression} @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
where @meta{test} is an expression.  Alternatively, a @meta{cond clause}
may be of the form:

@example
(@meta{test} => @meta{expression})
@end example

The last @meta{cond clause} may be an ``@code{else} clause'', which has
the form:

@example
(else @hyperi{expression} @hyperii{expression} @dots{})
@end example

A @func{cond} expression is evaluated by evaluating the @meta{test}
expressions of successive @meta{cond clause}s in order until one of them
evaluates to a true value.  When a @meta{test} evaluates to a true
value, then the remaining @meta{expression}s in its @meta{cond clause}
are evaluated in order, and the results of the last @meta{expression} in
the @meta{cond clause} are returned as the results of the entire
@func{cond} expression.

If the selected @meta{cond clause} contains only the @meta{test} and no
@meta{expression}s, then the value of the @meta{test} is returned as the
result.  If the selected @meta{cond clause} uses the @code{=>} alternate
form, then the @meta{expression} is evaluated.  Its value must be a
procedure.  This procedure should accept one argument; it is called on
the value of the @meta{test} and the values returned by this procedure
are returned by the @func{cond} expression.

If all @meta{test}s evaluate to @false{}, and there is no @code{else}
clause, then the conditional expression returns unspecified values; if
there is an @code{else} clause, then its @meta{expression}s are
evaluated, and the values of the last one are returned.

@example
(cond ((> 3 2) 'greater)
      ((< 3 2) 'less))          => greater

(cond ((> 3 3) 'greater)
      ((< 3 3) 'less)
      (else 'equal))            => equal

(cond ('(1 2 3) => cadr)
      (else #f))                => 2
@end example

For a @meta{cond clause} of one of the following forms:

@example
(@meta{test} @hyperi{expression} @dots{})
(else @hyperi{expression} @hyperii{expression} @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
the last @meta{expression} is in tail context if the @func{cond} form
itself is.  For a @meta{cond clause} of the form:

@example
(@meta{test} => @meta{expression})
@end example

@noindent
the (implied) call to the procedure that results from the evaluation of
@meta{expression} is in a tail context if the @func{cond} form itself
is.
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax case @meta{key} @hyperi{case clause} @hyperii{case clause} @dots{}
@meta{key} must be an expression.  Each @meta{case clause} must have one
of the following forms:

@example
((@hyperi{datum} @dots{}) @hyperi{expression} @hyperii{expression} @dots{})
(else @hyperi{expression} @hyperii{expression} @dots{})
@end example

The second form, which specifies an ``@code{else} clause'', may only
appear as the last @meta{case clause}.  Each @meta{datum} is an external
representation of some object.  The data represented by the
@meta{datum}s need not be distinct.

A @func{case} expression is evaluated as follows.

@enumerate
@item
@meta{key} is evaluated and its result is compared using @func{eqv?}
against the data represented by the @meta{datum}s of each @meta{case
clause} in turn, proceeding in order from left to right through the set
of clauses.

@item
If the result of evaluating @meta{key} is equivalent to a datum of a
@meta{case clause}, the corresponding @meta{expression}s are evaluated
from left to right and the results of the last expression in the
@meta{case clause} are returned as the results of the @func{case}
expression.  Otherwise, the comparison process continues.

@item
If the result of evaluating @meta{key} is different from every datum in
each set, then if there is an @code{else} clause its expressions are
evaluated and the results of the last are the results of the @func{case}
expression; otherwise the @func{case} expression returns unspecified
values.
@end enumerate

@example
(case (* 2 3)
  ((2 3 5 7) 'prime)
  ((1 4 6 8 9) 'composite))     => composite
(case (car '(c d))
  ((a) 'a)
  ((b) 'b))                     => unspecified
(case (car '(c d))
  ((a e i o u) 'vowel)
  ((w y) 'semivowel)
  (else 'consonant))            => consonant
@end example

The last @meta{expression} of a @meta{case clause} is in tail context if
the @func{case} expression itself is.
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax and @hyperi{test} @dots{}
The @meta{test}s must be expressions.

If there are no @meta{test}s, @true{} is returned.  Otherwise, the
@meta{test} expressions are evaluated from left to right until a
@meta{test} returns @false{} or the last @meta{test} is reached.  In the
former case, the @func{and} expression returns @false{} without
evaluating the remaining expressions.  In the latter case, the last
expression is evaluated and its values are returned.

@example
(and (= 2 2) (> 2 1))           =>  #t
(and (= 2 2) (< 2 1))           =>  #f
(and 1 2 'c '(f g))             =>  (f g)
(and)                           =>  #t
@end example

The @func{and} keyword could be defined in terms of @func{if} using
@func{syntax-rules} as follows:

@example
(define-syntax and
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((and) #t)
    ((and test) test)
    ((and test1 test2 ...)
     (if test1 (and test2 ...) #t))))
@end example

The last @meta{test} expression is in tail context if the @func{and}
expression itself is.
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax or @hyperi{test} @dots{}
The @meta{test}s must be expressions.

If there are no @meta{test}s, @false{} is returned.  Otherwise, the
@meta{test} expressions are evaluated from left to right until a
@meta{test} returns a true value @var{val} or the last @meta{test} is
reached.  In the former case, the @func{or} expression returns @var{val}
without evaluating the remaining expressions.  In the latter case, the
last expression is evaluated and its values are returned.

@example
(or (= 2 2) (> 2 1))            => #t
(or (= 2 2) (< 2 1))            => #t
(or #f #f #f)                   => #f
(or '(b c) (/ 3 0))             => (b c)
@end example

The @func{or} keyword could be defined in terms of @func{if} using
@func{syntax-rules} as follows:

@example
(define-syntax or
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((or) #f)

@subsection Binding constructs


The binding constructs described in this section create local bindings
for variables that are visible only in a delimited region.  The syntax
of the constructs @func{let}, @func{let*}, @func{letrec}, and
@func{letrec*} is identical, but they differ in the regions they
establish for their variable bindings and in the order in which the
values for the bindings are computed.

@itemize
@item
In a @func{let} expression, the initial values are computed before any
of the variables become bound; in a @func{let*} expression, the bindings
and evaluations are performed sequentially.

@item
In a @func{letrec} or @func{letrec*} expression, all the bindings are in
effect while their initial values are being computed, thus allowing
mutually recursive definitions.

@item
In a @func{letrec} expression, the initial values are computed before
being assigned to the variables; in a @func{letrec*}, the evaluations
and assignments are performed sequentially.
@end itemize

In addition, the binding constructs @func{let-values} and
@func{let*-values} generalize @func{let} and @func{let*} to allow
multiple variables to be bound to the results of expressions that
evaluate to multiple values.  They are analogous to @func{let} and
@func{let*} in the way they establish regions: in a @func{let-values}
expression, the initial values are computed before any of the variables
become bound; in a @func{let*-values} expression, the bindings are
performed sequentially.

@deffn Syntax let @meta{bindings} @meta{body}
@meta{bindings} must have the form:

@example
((@hyperi{variable} @metai{init}) @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
where each @meta{init} is an expression, and @meta{body} is as described
in @ref{baselib bodies}.  Any variable must not appear more than once in
the @meta{variable}s.

The @meta{init}s are evaluated in the current environment (in some
unspecified order), the @meta{variable}s are bound to fresh locations
holding the results, the @meta{body} is evaluated in the extended
environment, and the values of the last expression of @meta{body} are
returned.  Each binding of a @meta{variable} has @meta{body} as its
region.

@example
(let ((x 2) (y 3))
  (* x y))                      => 6

(let ((x 2) (y 3))
  (let ((x 7)
        (z (+ x y)))
    (* z x)))                   => 35
@end example

@example
((@hyperi{variable} @metai{init}) @dots{})
@end example

@noindent
where each @meta{init} is an expression, and @meta{body} is as described
in @ref{baselib bodies}.

The @func{let*} form is similar to @func{let}, but the @meta{init}s are
evaluated and bindings created sequentially from left to right, with the
region of each binding including the bindings to its right as well as
@meta{body}.  Thus the second @meta{init} is evaluated in an environment
in which the first binding is visible and initialized, and so on.

@example
(let ((x 2) (y 3))
  (let* ((x 7)
         (z (+ x y)))
    (* z x)))             => 70

be distinct, the variables bound by a @func{let*} expression need not be
distinct.

@meta{bindings} must have the form:

@end example

@noindent
where each @meta{init} is an expression, and @meta{body} is as described
in @ref{baselib bodies}.  Any variable must not appear more than once in
the @meta{variable}s.

The @meta{variable}s are bound to fresh locations, the @meta{init}s are
evaluated in the resulting environment (in some unspecified order), each
@meta{variable} is assigned to the result of the corresponding
@meta{init}, the @meta{body} is evaluated in the resulting environment,
and the values of the last expression in @meta{body} are returned.  Each
binding of a @meta{variable} has the entire @func{letrec} expression as
its region, making it possible to define mutually recursive procedures.

@example
(letrec ((even?
          (lambda (n)
            (if (zero? n)
                \schtrue
                (odd? (- n 1)))))
         (odd?
          (lambda (n)
            (if (zero? n)
                \schfalse
                (even? (- n 1))))))
  (even? 88))
=> #t
@end example

It should be possible to evaluate each @meta{init} without assigning or
referring to the value of any @meta{variable}.  In the most common uses
of @func{letrec}, all the @meta{init}s are @func{lambda}s and the
restriction is satisfied automatically.  Another restriction is that the
continuation of each @meta{init} should not be invoked more than once.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} Implementations must detect
references to a @meta{variable} during the evaluation of the @meta{init}
expressions (using one particular evaluation order and order of
evaluating the @meta{init} expressions).  If an implementation detects
such a violation of the restriction, it must raise an exception with
condition type @code{&assertion}.  Implementations may or may not detect
that the continuation of each @meta{init} is invoked more than once.
However, if the implementation detects this, it must raise an exception
with condition type @code{&assertion}.

the @meta{variable}s.

The @meta{variable}s are bound to fresh locations, each @meta{variable}
is assigned in left--to--right order to the result of evaluating the
corresponding @meta{init}, the @meta{body} is evaluated in the resulting
environment, and the values of the last expression in @meta{body} are
returned.  Despite the left--to--right evaluation and assignment order,
each binding of a @meta{variable} has the entire @func{letrec*}
expression as its region, making it possible to define mutually
recursive procedures.

@example
(letrec* ((p
           (lambda (x)
             (+ 1 (q (- x 1)))))
          (q
           (lambda (y)

                 0

          (x (p 5))
          (y x))
  y)
=>  5
@end example

It must be possible to evaluate each @meta{init} without assigning or
referring to the value of the corresponding @meta{variable} or the
@meta{variable} of any of the bindings that follow it in
@meta{bindings}.  Another restriction is that the continuation of each
@meta{init} should not be invoked more than once.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} Implementations must, during
the evaluation of an @meta{init} expression, detect references to the

in @ref{baselib bodies}.  Any variable must not appear more than once in
the set of @meta{formals}.

The @meta{init}s are evaluated in the current environment (in some
unspecified order), and the variables occurring in the @meta{formals}
are bound to fresh locations containing the values returned by the
@meta{init}s, where the @meta{formals} are matched to the return values
in the same way that the @meta{formals} in a @func{lambda} are matched
to the arguments in a procedure call.  Then, the @meta{body} is
evaluated in the extended environment, and the values of the last
expression of @meta{body} are returned.  Each binding of a variable has
@meta{body} as its region.  If the @meta{formals} do not match, an

The @meta{begin} keyword has two different roles, depending on its
context:

@itemize
@item
It may appear as a form in a @meta{body}, @meta{library body}, or
@meta{top-level body}, or directly nested in a @func{begin} form that
appears in a body.  In this case, the @func{begin} form must have the
shape specified in the first header line.  This use of @func{begin} acts
as a @emph{splicing} form: the forms inside the @meta{body} are spliced
into the surrounding body, as if the @func{begin} wrapper were not
actually present.

A @func{begin} form in a @meta{body} or @meta{library body} must be
non--empty if it appears after the first @meta{expression} within the
body.

@item
It may appear as an ordinary expression and must have the shape
specified in the second header line.  In this case, the
@meta{expression}s are evaluated sequentially from left to right, and
the values of the last @meta{expression} are returned.  This expression
type is used to sequence side effects such as assignments or input and
output.

@node baselib predicates
@section Equivalence and procedure predicates


A @emph{predicate} is a procedure that always returns a boolean value
(@true{} or @false{}).  An @emph{equivalence predicate} is the
computational analogue of a mathematical equivalence relation (it is
symmetric, reflexive, and transitive).  Of the equivalence predicates
described in this section, @func{eq?} is the finest or most
discriminating, and @func{equal?} is the coarsest.  The @func{eqv?}
predicate is slightly less discriminating than @func{eq?}.


@deffn Procedure {eqv?} @vari{obj} @varii{obj}
The @func{eqv?} procedure defines a useful equivalence relation on
objects.  Briefly, it returns @true{} if @vari{obj} and @varii{obj}
should normally be regarded as the same object and @false{} otherwise.
This relation is left slightly open to interpretation, but the following
partial specification of @func{eqv?} must hold for all implementations.

The @func{eqv?} procedure returns @true{} if one of the following holds:

@itemize
@item
@vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are both booleans and are the same according
to the @func{boolean=?} procedure.

@item
@vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are both symbols and are the same according
to the @func{symbol=?} procedure.

@item
@vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are both exact number objects and are
numerically equal (see @code{=}).

@item
@vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are both inexact number objects, are
numerically equal (see @code{=}), and yield the same results (in the
sense of @func{eqv?}) when passed as arguments to any other procedure
that can be defined as a finite composition of Scheme's standard
arithmetic procedures.

@item
@vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are both characters and are the same
character according to the @code{char=?} procedure.

@item
Both @vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are the empty list.

@item
@vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are objects such as pairs, vectors,
bytevectors (library chapter ``Bytevectors''), strings, hashtables,
records (library chapter ``Records''), ports (library section ``Port
I/O''), or hashtables (library chapter ``Hash tables'') that refer to
the same locations in the store.

@item
@vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are record--type descriptors that are
specified to be @func{eqv?} in library section ``Procedural layer''.
@end itemize

The @func{eqv?} procedure returns @false{} if one of the following
holds:

@itemize
@item
@vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are of different types.

@item
@vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are booleans for which the @func{boolean=?}
procedure returns @false{}.

@item
@vari{Obj} and @varii{obj} are symbols for which the @func{symbol=?}
procedure returns @false{}.

@item
One of @vari{obj} and @varii{obj} is an exact number object but the
other is an inexact number object.

@item
@vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are rational number objects for which the
@code{=} procedure returns @false{}.

@item
@vari{Obj} and @varii{obj} yield different results (in the sense of
@func{eqv?}) when passed as arguments to any other procedure that can be
defined as a finite composition of Scheme's standard arithmetic
procedures.

@item
@vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are characters for which the @func{char=?}
procedure returns @false{}.

@item
One of @vari{obj} and @varii{obj} is the empty list, but the other is
not.

@item
@vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are objects such as pairs, vectors,
bytevectors (library chapter ``Bytevectors''), strings, records (library
chapter ``Records''), ports (library section ``Port I/O''), or
hashtables (library chapter ``Hashtables'') that refer to distinct
locations.

@item
@vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are pairs, vectors, strings, or records, or
hashtables, where the applying the same accessor (i.e. @func{car},
@func{cdr}, @func{vector-ref}, @func{string-ref}, or record accessors)
to both yields results for which @func{eqv?} returns @false{}.

@item
@vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are procedures that would behave differently
(return different values or have different side effects) for some
arguments.
@end itemize

@quotation
@emph{Note:} The @func{eqv?} procedure returning @true{} when @vari{obj}
and @varii{obj} are number objects does not imply that @code{=} would
also return @true{} when called with @vari{obj} and @varii{obj} as
arguments.
@end quotation

@example
(eqv? 'a 'a)                     =>  #t
(eqv? 'a 'b)                     =>  #f
(eqv? 2 2)                       =>  #t
(eqv? '() '())                   =>  #t
(eqv? 100000000 100000000)       =>  #t
(eqv? (cons 1 2) (cons 1 2))     =>  #f
(eqv? (lambda () 1)
      (lambda () 2))             =>  #f
(eqv? #f 'nil)                   =>  #f
@end example

The following examples illustrate cases in which the above rules do not
fully specify the behavior of @func{eqv?}.  All that can be said about
such cases is that the value returned by @func{eqv?} must be a boolean.

@example
(let ((p (lambda (x) x)))
  (eqv? p p))                   => unspecified

(eqv? "" "")                    => unspecified

(eqv? '#() '#())                => unspecified

(eqv? (lambda (x) x)
      (lambda (x) x))           => unspecified

(eqv? (lambda (x) x)
      (lambda (y) y))           => unspecified

(eqv? +nan.0 +nan.0)            => unspecified
@end example

The next set of examples shows the use of @func{eqv?} with procedures
that have local state.  Calls to @func{gen-counter} must return a
distinct procedure every time, since each procedure has its own internal
counter.  Calls to @func{gen-loser} return procedures that behave
equivalently when called.  However, @func{eqv?} may not detect this
equivalence.

@example
(define gen-counter
  (lambda ()
    (let ((n 0))
      (lambda () (set! n (+ n 1)) n))))
(let ((g (gen-counter)))
  (eqv? g g))           =>  unspecified
(eqv? (gen-counter) (gen-counter))
                        =>  #f
(define gen-loser
  (lambda ()
    (let ((n 0))
      (lambda () (set! n (+ n 1)) 27))))
(let ((g (gen-loser)))
  (eqv? g g))           =>  unspecified
(eqv? (gen-loser) (gen-loser))
                        =>  unspecified

(letrec ((f (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'both 'f)))
         (g (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'both 'g))))
  (eqv? f g)) => unspecified

(letrec ((f (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'f 'both)))
         (g (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'g 'both))))
  (eqv? f g)) => #f
@end example

Implementations may share structure between constants where appropriate.
Furthermore, a constant may be copied at any time by the implementation
so as to exist simultaneously in different sets of locations.  Thus the
value of @func{eqv?} on constants is sometimes
implementation--dependent.

@example
(eqv? '(a) '(a))                 => unspecified
(eqv? "a" "a")                   => unspecified
(eqv? '(b) (cdr '(a b)))         => unspecified
(let ((x '(a)))
  (eqv? x x))                    => #t
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure eq? @vari{obj} @varii{obj}
The @func{eq?} predicate is similar to @func{eqv?} except that in some
cases it is capable of discerning distinctions finer than those
detectable by @func{eqv?}.

The @func{eq?} and @func{eqv?} predicates are guaranteed to have the
same behavior on symbols, booleans, the empty list, pairs, procedures,
non--empty strings, bytevectors, vectors, and records.  The behavior of
@func{eq?} on number objects and characters is
implementation--dependent, but it always returns either @true{} or
@false{}, and returns @true{} only when @func{eqv?} would also return
@true{}.  The @func{eq?} predicate may also behave differently from
@func{eqv?} on empty vectors, empty bytevectors, and empty strings.

@example
(eq? 'a 'a)                     => #t
(eq? '(a) '(a))                 => unspecified
(eq? (list 'a) (list 'a))       => #f
(eq? "a" "a")                   => unspecified
(eq? "" "")                     => unspecified
(eq? '() '())                   => #t
(eq? 2 2)                       => unspecified
(eq? #\A #\A)                   => unspecified
(eq? car car)                   => #t
(let ((n (+ 2 3)))
  (eq? n n))                    => unspecified
(let ((x '(a)))
  (eq? x x))                    => #t
(let ((x '#()))
  (eq? x x))                    => unspecified
(let ((p (lambda (x) x)))
  (eq? p p))                    => unspecified
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {equal?} @vari{obj} @varii{obj}
The @func{equal?}  predicate returns @true{} if and only if the
(possibly infinite) unfoldings of its arguments into regular trees are
equal as ordered trees.

The @func{equal?} predicate treats pairs and vectors as nodes with
outgoing edges, uses @func{string=?} to compare strings, uses
@func{bytevector=?} to compare bytevectors (see library chapter
``Bytevectors''), and uses @func{eqv?} to compare other nodes.

@example
(equal? 'a 'a)                  =>  #t

(equal? '(a) '(a))              =>  #t

(equal? '(a (b) c)
        '(a (b) c))             =>  #t

(equal? "abc" "abc")            =>  #t

(equal? 2 2)                    =>  #t

(equal? (make-vector 5 'a)
        (make-vector 5 'a))     =>  #t

(equal? '#vu8(1 2 3 4 5)
        (u8-list->bytevector
         '(1 2 3 4 5))          =>  #t

(equal? (lambda (x) x)
        (lambda (y) y))         =>  unspecified

(let* ((x (list 'a))
       (y (list 'a))
       (z (list x y)))
  (list (equal? z (list y x))
        (equal? z (list x x)))) =>  (#t #t)

its arguments contain cycles.

+            -            *
max          min          abs
numerator    denominator  gcd
lcm          floor        ceiling
truncate     round        rationalize
real-part    imag-part    make-rectangular
@end example

The procedures listed below must return the correct exact result
provided all their arguments are exact, and no divisors are zero:

@example
/
div          mod           div-and-mod
div0         mod0          div0-and-mod0
@end example

Moreover, the procedure @func{expt} must return the correct exact result
provided its first argument is an exact real number object and its
second argument is an exact integer object.

The general rule is that the generic operations return the correct exact
result when all of their arguments are exact and the result is
mathematically well--defined, but return an inexact result when any
argument is inexact.  Exceptions to this rule include:

@example
sqrt            exp             log
sin             cos             tan
asin            acos            atan
expt            make-polar      magnitude
angle
@end example

@noindent
which may (but are not required to) return inexact results even when
given exact arguments, as indicated in the specification of these
procedures.

One general exception to the rule above is that an implementation may
return an exact result despite inexact arguments if that exact result
would be the correct result for all possible substitutions of exact
arguments for the inexact ones.  An example is @code{(* 1.0 0)} which
may return either @code{0} (exact) or @code{0.0} (inexact).

@node baselib math infinities
@subsection Representability of infinities and NaNs


The specification of the numerical operations is written as though
infinities and NaNs are representable, and specifies many operations
with respect to these number objects in ways that are consistent with
the @ieee{} 754 standard for binary floating--point arithmetic.

An implementation of Scheme may or may not represent infinities and
NaNs; however, an implementation must raise a continuable exception with
condition type @code{&no-infinities} or @code{&no-nans} (respectively;
see library section ``Flonums'') whenever it is unable to represent an
infinity or NaN as specified.  In this case, the continuation of the
exception handler is the continuation that otherwise would have received
the infinity or NaN value.  This requirement also applies to conversions
between number objects and external representations, including the
reading of program source code.

@subsubsection Integer division


Scheme's operations for performing integer division rely on mathematical
operations @emph{div}, @emph{mod}, @emph{div_0}, and @emph{mod_0}, that
are defined as follows:

@itemize
@item
@emph{div}, @emph{mod}, @emph{div_0}, and @emph{mod_0} each accept two
real numbers @emph{x_1} and @emph{x_2} as operands, where @emph{x_2}
must be nonzero.

@item
@emph{div} returns an integer, and @emph{mod} returns a real.  Their
results are specified by:

@example
x_1 div x_2 = n_d
x_1 mod x_2 = x_m
@end example

@noindent
where:

@example
x_1 = n_d * x_2 + x_m
0  <= x_m < |x_2|
@end example

Examples:

@example
 123 div  10 =  12
 123 mod  10 =   3
 123 div -10 = -12
 123 mod -10 =   3
-123 div  10 = -13
-123 mod  10 =   7
-123 div -10 =  13
-123 mod -10 =   7
@end example

@item
@emph{div_0} and @emph{mod_0} are like @emph{div} and @emph{mod}, except
the result of @emph{mod_0} lies within a half--open interval centered on
zero.  The results are specified by:

@example
x_1 div_0 x_2 = n_d
x_1 mod_0 x_2 = x_m
@end example

@noindent
where:

@example
x_1 = n_d * x_2 + x_m
-|x_2/2| <= x_m < |x_2/2|
@end example

Examples:

@example
 123 div_0  10 =  12
 123 mod_0  10 =   3
 123 div_0 -10 = -12
 123 mod_0 -10 =   3
-123 div_0  10 = -12
-123 mod_0  10 =  -3
-123 div_0 -10 =  12
-123 mod_0 -10 =  -3
@end example
@end itemize

@subsubsection Transcendental functions


In general, the transcendental functions @emph{log}, @emph{sin^(-1)}
(arcsine), @emph{cos^(-1)} (arccosine), and @emph{tan^(-1)} are multiply
defined.  The value of @code{log z} is defined to be the one whose
imaginary part lies in the range from @code{-pi} (inclusive if
@code{-0.0} is distinguished, exclusive otherwise) to @code{pi}
(inclusive).  @code{log 0} is undefined.

The value of @code{log z} for non--real @var{z} is defined in terms of
log on real numbers as:

@example
log z = log |z| + (angle z) i
@end example

@noindent
where @code{angle z} is the angle of @code{z = a * e^(i * b)} specified
as:

@example
angle z = b + 2 pi n
@end example

with @code{-pi <= angle z <= \pi} and @code{angle z = b + 2 pi n} for
some integer @var{n}.

With the one--argument version of @emph{log} defined this way, the
values of the two--argument--version of @emph{log}, @code{sin^(-1) z},
@code{cos^(-1) z}, @code{tan^(-1) z}, and the two--argument version
of @code{tan^(-1)} are according to the following formulae:

@example
log_b z = (log z)/(log b)
sin^(-1) z = -i log (i z + sqrt(1 - z^2))
cos^(-1) z = pi/2 - sin^(-1) z
tan^(-1) z = (log (1 + i z) - log (1 - i z)) / (2 i)
tan^(-1) x y = angle(x + yi)
@end example

The range of @code{tan^(-1) x y} is as in the following table.  The
asterisk (*) indicates that the entry applies to implementations that
distinguish minus zero.

@multitable {*} {@emph{y} condition} {@emph{x} condition} {range of result @emph{r}}
@headitem @tab @emph{y} condition @tab @emph{x} condition @tab range of result @emph{r}

@subsubsection Numerical type predicates


@deffn Procedure {number?} @var{obj}
@deffnx Procedure {complex?} @var{obj}
@deffnx Procedure {real?} @var{obj}
@deffnx Procedure {rational?} @var{obj}
@deffnx Procedure {integer?} @var{obj}
These numerical type predicates can be applied to any kind of argument.
They return @true{} if the object is a number object of the named type,
and @false{} otherwise.  In general, if a type predicate is true of a
number object then all higher type predicates are also true of that
number object.  Consequently, if a type predicate is false of a number
object, then all lower type predicates are also false of that number
object.

If @var{z} is a complex number object, then @code{(real? @var{z})} is
true if and only if @code{(zero? (imag-part @var{z}))} and @code{(exact?
(imag-part @var{z}))} are both true.

If @var{x} is a real number object, then @code{(rational? @var{x})} is
true if and only if there exist exact integer objects @vari{k} and
@varii{k} such that @code{(= @var{x} (/ @vari{k} @varii{k}))} and
@code{(= (numerator @var{x}) @vari{k})} and @code{(= (denominator
@var{x}) @varii{k})} are all true.  Thus infinities and NaNs are not
rational number objects.

If @var{q} is a rational number objects, then @code{(integer? @var{q})}
is true if and only if @code{(= (denominator @var{q}) 1)} is true.  If
@var{q} is not a rational number object, then @code{(integer? @var{q})}
is @false{}.

(complex? 3+4i)                        => #t
(complex? 3)                           => #t

@deffn Procedure {real-valued?} @var{obj}
@deffnx Procedure {rational-valued?} @var{obj}
@deffnx Procedure {integer-valued?} @var{obj}
These numerical type predicates can be applied to any kind of argument.
The @func{real-valued?} procedure returns @true{} if the object is a
number object and is equal in the sense of @code{=} to some real number
object, or if the object is a NaN, or a complex number object whose real
part is a NaN and whose imaginary part is zero in the sense of
@func{zero?}.  The @func{rational-valued?} and @func{integer-valued?}
procedures return @true{} if the object is a number object and is equal
in the sense of @code{=} to some object of the named type, and otherwise
they return @false{}.

@example
(real-valued? +nan.0)                  => #t
(real-valued? +nan.0+0i)               => #t

@end example

@quotation
@emph{Note:} These procedures test whether a given number object can be
coerced to the specified type without loss of numerical accuracy.

objects whose imaginary part is inexact zero.

@deffn Procedure {exact?} @var{z}
@deffnx Procedure {inexact?} @var{z}
These numerical predicates provide tests for the exactness of a
quantity.  For any number object, precisely one of these predicates is
true.

@example

(inexact? +inf.0)            => #t

@c page
@node baselib math ops exactness
@subsubsection Exactness conversion


These procedures implement the natural one--to-one correspondence
between exact and inexact integer objects throughout an
implementation--dependent range.  The @func{inexact} and @func{exact}
procedures are idempotent.


@deffn Procedure inexact @var{z}
The @func{inexact} procedure returns an inexact representation of
@var{z}.  If inexact number objects of the appropriate type have bounded
precision, then the value returned is an inexact number object that is
nearest to the argument.  If an exact argument has no reasonably close
inexact equivalent, an exception with condition type
@code{&implementation-violation} may be raised.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} For a real number object whose magnitude is finite but so
large that it has no reasonable finite approximation as an inexact
number, a reasonably close inexact equivalent may be @code{+inf.0} or
@code{-inf.0}.  Similarly, the inexact representation of a complex
number object whose components are finite may have infinite components.
@end quotation
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure exact @var{z}
The @func{exact} procedure returns an exact representation of @var{z}.
The value returned is the exact number object that is numerically
closest to the argument; in most cases, the result of this procedure
should be numerically equal to its argument.  If an inexact argument has
no reasonably close exact equivalent, an exception with condition type
@code{&implementation-violation} may be raised.

@deffnx Procedure <= @vari{x} @varii{x} @variii{x} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure >= @vari{x} @varii{x} @variii{x} @dots{}
These procedures return @true{} if their arguments are (respectively):
equal, monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, monotonically
nondecreasing, or monotonically nonincreasing, and @false{} otherwise.

Examples:

@example

@example

(> +inf.0 @var{x} -inf.0)       => #t
@end example

@noindent
for any number object @var{z}:

@example
(= +nan.0 @var{z})              => #f

For any real number object @var{x}:

@example

These predicates must be transitive.

@emph{Note:} The traditional implementations of these predicates in
Lisp--like languages are not transitive.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} While it is possible to compare inexact number objects

@subsubsection Comparison


@deffn Procedure max @vari{x} @varii{x} @dots{}

@example
(max 3 4)                       =>  4
(max 3.9 4)                     =>  4.0

(min -inf.0 @var{x})            =>  -inf.0

@quotation
@emph{Note:} If any argument is inexact, then the result is also inexact
(unless the procedure can prove that the inaccuracy is not large enough
to affect the result, which is possible only in unusual
implementations).  If @func{min} or @func{max} is used to compare number
objects of mixed exactness, and the numerical value of the result cannot

(+ -inf.0 @var{x})                           =>  -inf.0

For any real number object @var{x}:

@example
(+ +nan.0 @var{x})                           =>  +nan.0

For any real number object @var{x} that is not an exact 0:

@example

@end example

If any of these procedures are applied to mixed non--rational real and
non--real complex arguments, they either raise an exception with
condition type @code{&implementation-restriction} or return an
unspecified number object.

Implementations that distinguish @code{-0.0} should adopt behavior
consistent with the following examples:

@example
(+  0.0 -0.0)  =>  0.0
(+ -0.0  0.0)  =>  0.0
(+  0.0  0.0)  =>  0.0
(+ -0.0 -0.0)  => -0.0

@deffnx Procedure - @vari{z} @varii{z} @variii{z} @dots{}
With two or more arguments, this procedures returns the difference of
its arguments, associating to the left.  With one argument, however, it
returns the additive inverse of its argument.

@example
(- 3 4)                                =>  -1
(- 3 4 5)                              =>  -6

@deffn Procedure / @var{z}
@deffnx Procedure / @vari{z} @varii{z} @variii{z} @dots{}
If all of the arguments are exact, then the divisors must all be
nonzero.  With two or more arguments, this procedure returns the
quotient of its arguments, associating to the left.  With one argument,
however, it returns the multiplicative inverse of its argument.

@example
(/ 3 4 5)                              =>  3/20
(/ 3)                                  =>  1/3

@deffn Procedure abs @var{x}
Returns the absolute value of its argument.

@example
(abs -7)                               =>  7

@deffnx Procedure div0-and-mod0 @vari{x} @varii{x}
@deffnx Procedure div0 @vari{x} @varii{x}
@deffnx Procedure mod0 @vari{x} @varii{x}
These procedures implement number--theoretic integer division and return
the results of the corresponding mathematical operations specified in
@ref{baselib math semantics integer}.  If @vari{x} and @varii{x} are
exact, @varii{x} must be nonzero. In the cases where the mathematical
requirements in @ref{baselib math semantics integer} cannot be satisfied
by any number object, either an exception is raised with condition type
@code{&implementation-restriction}, or unspecified number objects (one
for for @func{div}, @func{mod}, @func{div0} and @func{mod0}, two for
@func{div-and-mod} and @func{div0-and-mod0}) are returned.

@example
(div @vari{x} @varii{x})                => @vari{x} div @varii{x}
(mod @vari{x} @varii{x})                => @vari{x} mod @varii{x}

(div-and-mod @vari{x} @varii{x})
=> @vari{x} div @varii{x}, @vari{x} mod @varii{x} ;; two return values

(div0 @vari{x} @varii{x})               => @vari{x} div_0 @varii{x}

@deffn Procedure gcd @vari{n} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure lcm @vari{n} @dots{}
These procedures return the greatest common divisor or least common
multiple of their arguments.  The result is always non--negative.

@example
(gcd 32 -36)                           =>  4
(gcd)                                  =>  0

@deffn Procedure numerator @var{q}
@deffnx Procedure denominator @var{q}
These procedures return the numerator or denominator of their argument;
the result is computed as if the argument was represented as a fraction
in lowest terms.  The denominator is always positive.  The denominator
of @code{0} is defined to be @code{1}.

@example
(numerator   (/ 6 4))                  =>  3
(denominator (/ 6 4))                  =>  2

@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure floor @var{x}
@deffnx Procedure ceiling @var{x}
@deffnx Procedure truncate @var{x}
@deffnx Procedure round @var{x}
These procedures return inexact integer objects for inexact arguments
that are not infinities or NaNs, and exact integer objects for exact
rational arguments.

@table @func
@item floor
Returns the largest integer object not larger than @var{x}.

@item ceiling
Returns the smallest integer object not smaller than @var{x}.

@item truncate
Returns the integer object closest to @var{x} whose absolute value is
not larger than the absolute value of @var{x}.

@item round
Returns the closest integer object to @var{x}, rounding to even when
@var{x} represents a number halfway between two integers.
@end table

If the argument to one of these procedures is inexact, then the result
is also inexact.  If an exact value is needed, the result should be
passed to the @func{exact} procedure.

Although infinities and NaNs are not integer objects, these procedures
return an infinity when given an infinity as an argument, and a NaN when
given a NaN.

@example
(floor -4.3)                           =>  -5.0
(ceiling -4.3)                         =>  -4.0
(truncate -4.3)                        =>  -4.0
(round -4.3)                           =>  -4.0

(floor 3.5)                            =>  3.0
(ceiling 3.5)                          =>  4.0
(truncate 3.5)                         =>  3.0

(round 7)                              =>  7

(floor +inf.0)                         =>  +inf.0
(ceiling -inf.0)                       =>  -inf.0

@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure rationalize @vari{x} @varii{x}
The @func{rationalize} procedure returns a number object representing
the @emph{simplest} rational number differing from @vari{x} by no more
than @varii{x}.

A rational number @emph{r_1} is @emph{simpler} than another rational
number @emph{r_2} if @code{r_1 = p_1/q_1} and @code{r_2 = p_2/q_2} (in
lowest terms) and @code{|p_1| <= |p_2|} and @code{|q_1| <= |q_2|}.  Thus
@code{3/5} is simpler than @code{4/7}.

Although not all rationals are comparable in this ordering (consider
@code{2/7} and @code{3/5}) any interval contains a rational number that
is simpler than every other rational number in that interval (the
simpler @code{2/5} lies between @code{2/7} and @code{3/5}).

Note that @code{0 = 0/1} is the simplest rational of all.

@example
(rationalize (exact .3) 1/10)          => 1/3
(rationalize .3 1/10)                  => #i1/3  ; approximately

(rationalize +inf.0 3)                 =>  +inf.0
(rationalize +inf.0 +inf.0)            =>  +nan.0
(rationalize 3 +inf.0)                 =>  0.0
@end example

The first two examples hold only in implementations whose inexact real
number objects have sufficient precision.

@deffnx Procedure atan @vari{x} @varii{x}
These procedures compute the usual transcendental functions.

The @func{exp} procedure computes the base--@var{e} exponential of
@var{z}.

The @func{log} procedure with a single argument computes the natural
logarithm of @var{z} (@strong{not} the base--10 logarithm); @code{(log

The @func{asin}, @func{acos}, and @func{atan} procedures compute
arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent, respectively.  The two--argument
variant of @func{atan} computes:

@example
(angle (make-rectangular @varii{x} @vari{x}))

These procedures may return inexact results even when given exact

@subsubsection Exponentiation functions


@deffn Procedure sqrt @var{z}
Return the principal square root of @var{z}.  For rational @var{z}, the
result has either positive real part, or zero real part and
non--negative imaginary part.  With @emph{log} defined as in
@ref{baselib math semantics trascend}, the value of @code{(sqrt
@var{z})} could be expressed as:

@example
e^((log z)/2)
@end example

The @func{sqrt} procedure may return an inexact result even when given
an exact argument.

@example
(sqrt -5)                   =>  0.0+2.23606797749979i ; approximately

@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure exact-integer-sqrt @var{k}
The @func{exact-integer-sqrt} procedure returns two non--negative exact
integer objects @emph{s} and @emph{r} where @code{@var{k} = s^2 + r} and
@code{@var{k} < (s+1)^2}.

@example
(exact-integer-sqrt 4)  => 2 0 ; two return values
(exact-integer-sqrt 5)  => 2 1 ; two return values
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure expt @vari{z} @varii{z}
Return @vari{z} raised to the power @varii{z}.  For non--zero @vari{z},
this is @code{e^(z_2 log z_1)}.  @code{0.0^z} is @code{1.0} if
@code{@var{z} = 0.0}, and @code{0.0} if @code{(real-part @var{z})} is
positive.  For other cases in which the first argument is zero, either
an exception is raised with condition type
@code{&implementation-restriction}, or an unspecified number object is
returned.

For an exact real number object @vari{z} and an exact integer object
@varii{z}, @code{(expt @vari{z} @varii{z})} must return an exact result.
For all other values of @vari{z} and @varii{z}, @code{(expt @vari{z}
@varii{z})} may return an inexact result, even when both @vari{z} and
@varii{z} are exact.

@example

Moreover, suppose @vari{x}, @varii{x} are such that either @vari{x} or

The @func{number->string} procedure takes a number object and a radix

@example
(let ((number   @var{z})

    number))
@end example

@noindent
is true.  If no possible result makes this expression true, an exception
with condition type @code{&implementation-restriction} is raised.

@var{radix} must be an exact integer object, either @code{2}, @code{8},
@code{10}, or @code{16}.  If omitted, @var{radix} defaults to @code{10}.
If a @var{precision} is specified, then @var{z} must be an inexact
complex number object, @var{precision} must be an exact positive integer
object, and @var{radix} must be @code{10}.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} The error case can occur only when @var{z} is not a complex
number object or is a complex number object with a non--rational real or
imaginary part.
@end quotation

If a @var{precision} is specified, then the representations of the
inexact real components of the result, unless they are infinite or NaN,
specify an explicit @meta{mantissa width} @var{p}, and @var{p} is the
least @emph{@var{p} >= @var{precision}} for which the above expression
is true.

If @var{z} is inexact, the radix is @code{10}, and the above expression
and condition can be satisfied by a result that contains a decimal
point, then the result contains a decimal point and is expressed using
the minimum number of digits (exclusive of exponent, trailing zeroes,
and mantissa width) needed to make the above expression and condition
true; otherwise the format of the result is unspecified.

The result returned by @func{number->string} never contains an explicit
radix prefix.

@deffn Procedure {string->number} @var{string}
@deffnx Procedure {string->number} @var{string} @var{radix}
Return a number object with maximally precise representation expressed

@var{radix} must be an exact integer object, either @code{2}, @code{8},
@code{10}, or @code{16}.  If supplied, @var{radix} is a default radix
that may be overridden by an explicit radix prefix in @var{string}
(e.g. @code{#o177}).  If @var{radix} is not supplied, then the default
radix is @code{10}.

If @var{string} is not a syntactically valid notation for a number
object or a notation for a rational number object with a zero
denominator, then @func{string->number} returns @false{}.

@example
(string->number "100")                 => 100

@section Pairs and lists


A @emph{pair} is a compound structure with two fields called the car and
cdr fields (for historical reasons).  Pairs are created by the procedure
@func{cons}.  The car and cdr fields are accessed by the procedures
@func{car} and @func{cdr}.

Pairs are used primarily to represent lists.  A list can be defined
recursively as either the empty list or a pair whose cdr is a list.
More precisely, the set of lists is defined as the smallest set @var{X}
such that:

@itemize
@item
The empty list is in @var{X}.

@item
If @var{list} is in @var{X}, then any pair whose cdr field contains
@var{list} is also in @var{X}.
@end itemize

The objects in the car fields of successive pairs of a list are the
elements of the list.  For example, a two--element list is a pair whose
car is the first element and whose cdr is a pair whose car is the second
element and whose cdr is the empty list.  The length of a list is the
number of elements, which is the same as the number of pairs.

The empty list is a special object of its own type.  It is not a pair.
It has no elements and its length is zero.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} The above definitions imply that all lists have finite
length and are terminated by the empty list.
@end quotation

A chain of pairs not ending in the empty list is called an
@emph{improper list}.  Note that an improper list is not a list.  The
list and dotted notations can be combined to represent improper lists:

@example
(a b c . d)
@end example

@noindent
is equivalent to

@example
(a . (b . (c . d)))
@end example

Whether a given pair is a list depends upon what is stored in the cdr
field.


@deffn Procedure {pair?} @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a pair, @false{} otherwise.

@example
(pair? '(a . b))        => #t
(pair? '(a b c))        => #t
(pair? '())             => #f
(pair? '#(a b))         => #f
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure cons @vari{obj} @varii{obj}
Return a newly allocated pair whose car is @vari{obj} and whose cdr is
@varii{obj}.  The pair is guaranteed to be different (in the sense of
@func{eqv?}) from every existing object.

@example
(cons 'a '())           =>  (a)
(cons '(a) '(b c d))    =>  ((a) b c d)
(cons "a" '(b c))       =>  ("a" b c)
(cons 'a 3)             =>  (a . 3)
(cons '(a b) 'c)        =>  ((a b) . c)
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure car @var{pair}
Return the contents of the car field of @var{pair}.

@example
(car '(a b c))          => a
(car '((a) b c d))      => (a)
(car '(1 . 2))          => 1
(car '())               => exception &assertion
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure cdr @var{pair}
Return the contents of the cdr field of @var{pair}.

@example
(cdr '((a) b c d))      => (b c d)
(cdr '(1 . 2))          => 2
(cdr '())               => exception &assertion
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure caar @var{pair}
@deffnx Procedure cadr @var{pair}
@deffnx Procedure ...
@deffnx Procedure cdddar @var{pair}
@deffnx Procedure cddddr @var{pair}
These procedures are compositions of @func{car} and @func{cdr}, where
for example @func{caddr} could be defined by

@example
(define caddr (lambda (x) (car (cdr (cdr x)))))
@end example

Arbitrary compositions, up to four deep, are provided.  There are
twenty--eight of these procedures in all.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {null?} @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is the empty list, @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {list?} @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a list, @false{} otherwise.  By
definition, all lists are chains of pairs that have finite length and
are terminated by the empty list.

@example
(list? '(a b c))     => #t
(list? '())          => #t
(list? '(a . b))     => #f
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure list @var{obj} @dots{}
Return a newly allocated list of its arguments.

@example
(list 'a (+ 3 4) 'c)    => (a 7 c)
(list)                  => ()
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure length @var{list}
Return the length of @var{list}.

@example
(length '(a b c))               =>  3
(length '(a (b) (c d e)))       =>  3
(length '())                    =>  0
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure append
@deffnx Procedure append @var{list} @dots{} @var{obj}
Return a possibly improper list consisting of the elements of the first
@var{list} followed by the elements of the other @var{list}s, with
@var{obj} as the cdr of the final pair.  An improper list results if
@var{obj} is not a list.

@example
(append '(x) '(y))              =>  (x y)
(append '(a) '(b c d))          =>  (a b c d)
(append '(a (b)) '((c)))        =>  (a (b) (c))
(append '(a b) '(c . d))        =>  (a b c . d)
(append '() 'a)                 =>  a
@end example

If @func{append} constructs a non--empty chain of pairs, it is always
newly allocated.  If no pairs are allocated, @var{obj} is returned.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure reverse @var{list}
Return a newly allocated list consisting of the elements of @var{list}
in reverse order.

@example
(reverse '(a b c))              => (c b a)
(reverse '(a (b c) d (e (f))))  => ((e (f)) d (b c) a)
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure list-tail @var{list} @var{k}
@var{list} should be a list of size at least @var{k}.  Return the
subchain of pairs of @var{list} obtained by omitting the first @var{k}
elements.

@example
(list-tail '(a b c d) 2)        =>  (c d)
@end example

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
that @var{list} is a chain of pairs whose length is at least @var{k}.
It should not check that it is a chain of pairs beyond this length.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure list-ref @var{list} @var{k}
@var{list} must be a list whose length is at least @emph{@var{k} + 1}.
The @func{list-tail} procedure returns the @var{k}th element of
@var{list}.

@example
(list-ref '(a b c d) 2)         => c
@end example

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
that @var{list} is a chain of pairs whose length is at least
@emph{@var{k} + 1}.  It should not check that it is a list of pairs
beyond this length.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure map @var{proc} @vari{list} @varii{list} @dots{}
The @var{list}s should all have the same length.  @var{proc} should
accept as many arguments as there are @var{list}s and return a single
value.  @var{proc} should not mutate any of the @var{list}s.

The @func{map} procedure applies @var{proc} element--wise to the
elements of the @var{list}s and returns a list of the results, in order.
@var{proc} is always called in the same dynamic environment as
@func{map} itself.  The order in which @var{proc} is applied to the
elements of the @var{list}s is unspecified.  If multiple returns occur
from @func{map}, the values returned by earlier returns are not mutated.

@example
(map cadr '((a b) (d e) (g h)))         =>  (b e h)

(map (lambda (n) (expt n n))
     '(1 2 3 4 5))                      =>  (1 4 27 256 3125)

(map + '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))               =>  (5 7 9)

(let ((count 0))
  (map (lambda (ignored)
         (set! count (+ count 1))
         count)
       '(a b)))                         =>  (1 2) or (2 1)
@end example

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation should
check that the @var{list}s all have the same length.  The implementation
must check the restrictions on @var{proc} to the extent performed by
applying it as described.  An implementation may check whether
@var{proc} is an appropriate argument before applying it.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure for-each @var{proc} @vari{list} @varii{list} @dots{}
The @var{list}s should all have the same length.  @var{proc} should
accept as many arguments as there are @var{list}s.  @var{proc} should
not mutate any of the @var{list}s.

The @func{for-each} procedure applies @var{proc} element--wise to the
elements of the @var{list}s for its side effects, in order from the
first elements to the last.  @var{proc} is always called in the same
dynamic environment as @func{for-each} itself.  The return values of
@func{for-each} are unspecified.

@example
(let ((v (make-vector 5)))
  (for-each (lambda (i)
              (vector-set! v i (* i i)))
            '(0 1 2 3 4))
  v)
=>  #(0 1 4 9 16)

(for-each (lambda (x) x) '(1 2 3 4))
=> unspecified

(for-each even? '())
=> unspecified
@end example

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation should
check that the @var{list}s all have the same length.  The implementation
must check the restrictions on @var{proc} to the extent performed by
applying it as described.  An implementation may check whether
@var{proc} is an appropriate argument before applying it.

@section Symbols


Symbols are objects whose usefulness rests on the fact that two symbols
are identical (in the sense of @func{eq?}, @func{eqv?} and
@func{equal?}) if and only if their names are spelled the same way.  A
symbol literal is formed using @func{quote}.


@deffn Procedure {symbol?} @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a symbol, @false{} otherwise.

@example
(symbol? 'foo)          => #t
(symbol? (car '(a b)))  => #t
(symbol? "bar")         => #f
(symbol? 'nil)          => #t

(symbol? #f)            => #f
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {symbol->string} @var{symbol}
Return the name of @var{symbol} as an immutable string.

@example
(symbol->string 'flying-fish)                   =>  "flying-fish"
(symbol->string 'Martin)                        =>  "Martin"

Return @true{} if the symbols are the same, i.e., if their names are
spelled the same.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {string->symbol} @var{string}
Return the symbol whose name is @var{string}.

@example
(eq? 'mISSISSIppi 'mississippi)
=> #f

(string->symbol "mISSISSIppi")
=> the symbol with name "mISSISSIppi"

(eq? 'bitBlt (string->symbol "bitBlt"))
=> #t

(eq? 'JollyWog (string->symbol (symbol->string 'JollyWog)))

@section Characters


@emph{Characters} are objects that represent Unicode scalar values.

@quotation
Unicode defines a standard mapping between sequences of @emph{Unicode
scalar values} (integers in the range @code{0} to @code{#x10FFFF},
excluding the range @code{#xD800} to @code{#xDFFF}) in the latest
version of the standard and human--readable ``characters''.

More precisely, Unicode distinguishes between glyphs, which are printed
for humans to read, and characters, which are abstract entities that map
to glyphs (sometimes in a way that's sensitive to surrounding
characters).  Furthermore, different sequences of scalar values
sometimes correspond to the same character.  The relationships among
scalar, characters, and glyphs are subtle and complex.

Despite this complexity, most things that a literate human would call a
``character'' can be represented by a single Unicode scalar value
(although several sequences of Unicode scalar values may represent that
same character).  For example, Roman letters, Cyrillic letters, Hebrew
consonants, and most Chinese characters fall into this category.

Unicode scalar values exclude the range @code{#xD800} to @code{#xDFFF},
which are part of the range of Unicode @emph{code points}.  However, the
Unicode code points in this range, the so--called @emph{surrogates}, are
an artifact of the @utf{}--16 encoding, and can only appear in specific
Unicode encodings, and even then only in pairs that encode scalar
values.  Consequently, all characters represent code points, but the
surrogate code points do not have representations as characters.
@end quotation


@deffn Procedure {char?} @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a character, @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {char->integer} @var{char}
@deffnx Procedure {integer->char} @var{sv}
@var{sv} must be a Unicode scalar value, i.e., a non--negative exact
integer object in @code{[0, #xD7FF] union [#xE000, #x10FFFF]}.

Given a character, @func{char->integer} returns its Unicode scalar value
as an exact integer object.  For a Unicode scalar value @var{sv},
@func{integer->char} returns its associated character.

@example
(integer->char 32) =>                   #\space
(char->integer (integer->char 5000))    => 5000
(integer->char #\xD800)                 => exception &assertion
@end example
@end deffn

@deffnx Procedure {char<=?} @vari{char} @varii{char} @variii{char} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {char>=?} @vari{char} @varii{char} @variii{char} @dots{}
These procedures impose a total ordering on the set of characters
according to their Unicode scalar values.

@section Strings


Strings are sequences of characters.  The @emph{length} of a string is
the number of characters that it contains.  This number is fixed when
the string is created.  The @emph{valid indices} of a string are the
integers less than the length of the string.  The first character of a
string has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on.


@deffn Procedure {string?} @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a string, @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure make-string @var{k}
@deffnx Procedure make-string @var{k} @var{char}
Return a newly allocated string of length @var{k}.  If @var{char} is
given, then all elements of the string are initialized to @var{char},
otherwise the contents of the @var{string} are unspecified.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure string @var{char} @dots{}
Return a newly allocated string composed of the arguments.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure string-length @var{string}
Return the number of characters in the given @var{string} as an exact
integer object.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure string-ref @var{string} @var{k}
@var{k} must be a valid index of @var{string}.  The @func{string-ref}
procedure returns character @var{k} of @var{string} using zero--origin
indexing.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Implementors should make @func{string-ref} run in constant
time.
@end quotation
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {string=?} @vari{string} @varii{string} @variii{string} @dots{}
Return @true{} if the strings are the same length and contain the same
characters in the same positions.  Otherwise, the @func{string=?}
procedure returns @false{}.

@example
(string=? "Strause" "Strasse")    => #f
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {string<?} @vari{string} @varii{string} @variii{string} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {string>?} @vari{string} @varii{string} @variii{string} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {string<=?} @vari{string} @varii{string} @variii{string} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {string>=?} @vari{string} @varii{string} @variii{string} @dots{}
These procedures are the lexicographic extensions to strings of the
corresponding orderings on characters.  For example, @func{string<?} is
the lexicographic ordering on strings induced by the ordering
@func{char<?} on characters.  If two strings differ in length but are
the same up to the length of the shorter string, the shorter string is
considered to be lexicographically less than the longer string.

@example
(string<? "z" "a")      => #t
(string<? "z" "zz")     => #t
(string<? "z" "Z")      => #f
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure substring @var{string} @var{start} @var{end}
@var{string} must be a string, and @var{start} and @var{end} must be
exact integer objects satisfying:

@example
0 <= @var{start} <= @var{end} <= (string-length @var{string})
@end example

The @func{substring} procedure returns a newly allocated string formed
from the characters of @var{string} beginning with index @var{start}
(inclusive) and ending with index @var{end} (exclusive).
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure string-append @var{string} @dots{}
Return a newly allocated string whose characters form the concatenation
of the given strings.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure string->list @var{string}
@deffnx Procedure list->string @var{list}
@var{list} must be a list of characters.

The @func{string->list} procedure returns a newly allocated list of the
characters that make up the given string.

The @func{list->string} procedure returns a newly allocated string
formed from the characters in @var{list}.

The @func{string->list} and @func{list->string} procedures are inverses
so far as @func{equal?} is concerned.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure string-for-each @var{proc} @vari{string} @varii{string} @dots{}
The @var{string}s must all have the same length.  @var{proc} should
accept as many arguments as there are @var{string}s.

The @func{string-for-each} procedure applies @var{proc} element--wise to
the characters of the @var{string}s for its side effects, in order from
the first characters to the last.  @var{proc} is always called in the
same dynamic environment as @func{string-for-each} itself.  The return
values of @func{string-for-each} are unspecified.

Analogous to @func{for-each}.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
the restrictions on @var{proc} to the extent performed by applying it as

@node baselib vectors
@section Vectors


Vectors are heterogeneous structures whose elements are indexed by
integers.  A vector typically occupies less space than a list of the
same length, and the average time needed to access a randomly chosen
element is typically less for the vector than for the list.

The @emph{length} of a vector is the number of elements that it
contains.  This number is a non--negative integer that is fixed when the
vector is created.  The @emph{valid indices} of a vector are the exact
non--negative integer objects less than the length of the vector.  The
first element in a vector is indexed by zero, and the last element is
indexed by one less than the length of the vector.

Like list constants, vector constants must be quoted:

@example
'#(0 (2 2 2 2) "Anna")     =>  #(0 (2 2 2 2) "Anna")
@end example


@deffn Procedure vector? @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a vector, @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure make-vector @var{k}
@deffnx Procedure make-vector @var{k} @var{fill}
Return a newly allocated vector of @var{k} elements.  If a second
argument is given, then each element is initialized to @var{fill}.
Otherwise the initial contents of each element is unspecified.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure vector @var{obj} @dots{}
Return a newly allocated vector whose elements contain the given
arguments.  Analogous to @code{list}.

@example
(vector 'a 'b 'c)               =>  #(a b c)
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure vector-length @var{vector}
Return the number of elements in @var{vector} as an exact integer
object.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure vector-ref @var{vector} @var{k}
@var{k} must be a valid index of @var{vector}.  The @func{vector-ref}
procedure returns the contents of element @var{k} of @var{vector}.

@example
(vector-ref '#(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21) 5)     =>  8
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure vector-set! @var{vector} @var{k} @var{obj}
@var{k} must be a valid index of @var{vector}.  The @func{vector-set!}
procedure stores @var{obj} in element @var{k} of @var{vector}, and
returns unspecified.

Passing an immutable vector to @func{vector-set!} should cause an
exception with condition type @code{&assertion} to be raised.

@example
(let ((vec (vector 0 '(2 2 2 2) "Anna")))
  (vector-set! vec 1 '("Sue" "Sue"))
  vec)
=>  #(0 ("Sue" "Sue") "Anna")

(vector-set! '#(0 1 2) 1 "doe")

    ;; constant vector
    ;; should raise exception &assertion
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure vector->list @var{vector}
@deffnx Procedure list->vector @var{list}
The @func{vector->list} procedure returns a newly allocated list of the
objects contained in the elements of @var{vector}.

The @func{list->vector} procedure returns a newly created vector
initialized to the elements of the list @var{list}.

@example
(vector->list '#(dah dah didah))        =>  (dah dah didah)
(list->vector '(dididit dah))           =>  #(dididit dah)
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {vector-fill!} @var{vector fill}
Store @var{fill} in every element of @var{vector} and returns
unspecified.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure vector-map @var{proc} @vari{vector} @varii{vector} @dots{}
The @var{vector}s must all have the same length.  @var{proc} should
accept as many arguments as there are @var{vector}s and return a single
value.

The @func{vector-map} procedure applies @var{proc} element--wise to the
elements of the @var{vector}s and returns a vector of the results, in
order.  @var{proc} is always called in the same dynamic environment as
@func{vector-map} itself.  The order in which @var{proc} is applied to
the elements of the @var{vector}s is unspecified.  If multiple returns
occur from @func{vector-map}, the return values returned by earlier
returns are not mutated.

Analogous to @func{map}.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
the restrictions on @var{proc} to the extent performed by applying it as
described.  An implementation may check whether @var{proc} is an
appropriate argument before applying it.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure vector-for-each @var{proc} @vari{vector} @varii{vector} @dots{}
The @var{vector}s must all have the same length.  @var{proc} should

@code{vector-for-each} procedure applies @var{proc} element--wise to the
elements of the @var{vector}s for its side effects, in order from the
first elements to the last.  @var{proc} is always called in the same
dynamic environment as @func{vector-for-each} itself.  The return values
of @func{vector-for-each} are unspecified.

Analogous to @func{for-each}.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
the restrictions on @var{proc} to the extent performed by applying it as
described.  An implementation may check whether @var{proc} is an
appropriate argument before applying it.

@section Errors and violations


@deffn Procedure error @var{who} @var{message} @vari{irritant} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure assertion-violation @var{who} @var{message} @vari{irritant} @dots{}
@var{who} must be a string or a symbol or @false{}.  @var{message} must
be a string.  The @var{irritant}s are arbitrary objects.

These procedures raise an exception.  The @func{error} procedure should
be called when an error has occurred, typically caused by something that
has gone wrong in the interaction of the program with the external world
or the user.  The @func{assertion-violation} procedure should be called
when an invalid call to a procedure was made, either passing an invalid
number of arguments, or passing an argument that it is not specified to
handle.

The @var{who} argument should describe the procedure or operation that
detected the exception.  The @var{message} argument should describe the
exceptional situation.  The @var{irritant}s should be the arguments to
the operation that detected the operation.

The condition object provided with the exception has the following
condition types:

@itemize
@item
If @var{who} is not @false{}, the condition has condition type
@code{&who}, with @var{who} as the value of its field.  In that case,
@var{who} should be the name of the procedure or entity that detected
the exception.  If it is @false{}, the condition does not have condition
type @code{&who}.

@item
The condition has condition type @code{&message}, with @var{message} as
the value of its field.

@item
The condition has condition type @code{&irritants}, and its field has as
its value a list of the @var{irritant}s.
@end itemize

Moreover, the condition created by @func{error} has condition type
@code{&error}, and the condition created by @func{assertion-violation}
has condition type @code{&assertion}.

@example
(define (fac n)
  (if (not (integer-valued? n))
      (assertion-violation
       'fac "non-integral argument" n))
  (if (negative? n)
      (assertion-violation
       'fac "negative argument" n))
  (letrec
    ((loop (lambda (n r)
             (if (zero? n)
                 r
                 (loop (- n 1) (* r n))))))
      (loop n 1)))

(fac 5)         => 120
(fac 4.5)       => exception &assertion
(fac -3)        => exception &assertion
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax assert @meta{expression}
An @func{assert} form is evaluated by evaluating @meta{expression}.  If
@meta{expression} returns a true value, that value is returned from the
@func{assert} expression.  If @meta{expression} returns @false{}, an
exception with condition types @code{&assertion} and @code{&message} is
raised.  The message provided in the condition object is
implementation--dependent.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Implementations should exploit the fact that @func{assert}
is syntax to provide as much information as possible about the location
of the assertion failure.

@node baselib control
@section Control features


This chapter describes various primitive procedures which control the
flow of program execution in special ways.


@deffn Procedure apply @var{proc} @vari{arg} @dots{} @var{rest-args}
@var{rest-args} must be a list.  @var{proc} should accept @emph{n}
arguments, where @emph{n} is number of @var{arg}s plus the length of
@var{rest-args}.  The @func{apply} procedure calls @var{proc} with the
elements of the list:

@example
(append (list @vari{arg} @dots{}) @var{rest-args})
@end example

@noindent
as the actual arguments.

If a call to @func{apply} occurs in a tail context, the call to
@var{proc} is also in a tail context.

@example
(apply + (list 3 4))                    =>  7

(define compose
  (lambda (f g)
    (lambda args
      (f (apply g args)))))

((compose sqrt *) 12 75)                =>  30
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure call-with-current-continuation @var{proc}
@deffnx Procedure call/cc @var{proc}
@var{proc} should accept one argument.  The procedure @func{call/cc}
(which is the same as the procedure
@func{call-with-current-continuation}) packages the current continuation
as an ``escape procedure'' and passes it as an argument to @var{proc}.

The escape procedure is a Scheme procedure that, if it is later called,
will abandon whatever continuation is in effect at that later time and
will instead reinstate the continuation that was in effect when the
escape procedure was created.

Calling the escape procedure may cause the invocation of @var{before}
and @var{after} procedures installed using @func{dynamic-wind}.

The escape procedure accepts the same number of arguments as the
continuation of the original call to @func{call/cc}.

The escape procedure that is passed to @var{proc} has unlimited extent
just like any other procedure in Scheme.  It may be stored in variables
or data structures and may be called as many times as desired.

If a call to @func{call/cc} occurs in a tail context, the call to
@var{proc} is also in a tail context.

The following examples show only some ways in which @func{call/cc} is
used.  If all real uses were as simple as these examples, there would be
no need for a procedure with the power of @func{call/cc}.

@example
(call-with-current-continuation
  (lambda (exit)
    (for-each (lambda (x)
                (if (negative? x)
                    (exit x)))
              '(54 0 37 -3 245 19))
    #t))
=>  -3

(define list-length
  (lambda (obj)
    (call-with-current-continuation
      (lambda (return)
        (letrec ((r
                  (lambda (obj)
                    (cond ((null? obj) 0)
                          ((pair? obj)
                           (+ (r (cdr obj)) 1))
                          (else (return #f))))))
          (r obj))))))

(list-length '(1 2 3 4))                        =>  4
(list-length '(a b . c))                        => #f
(call-with-current-continuation procedure?)     => #t
@end example

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Calling an escape procedure reenters the dynamic extent of
the call to @func{call/cc}, and thus restores its dynamic environment.
@end quotation
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure values @var{obj} @dots{}
Delivers all of its arguments to its continuation.  The @func{values}
procedure might be defined as follows:

@example
(define (values . things)
  (call-with-current-continuation
    (lambda (cont) (apply cont things))))
@end example

The continuations of all non--final expressions within a sequence of
expressions, such as in @func{lambda}, @func{begin}, @func{let},
@func{let*}, @func{letrec}, @func{letrec*}, @func{let-values},
@func{let*-values}, @func{case}, and @func{cond} forms, usually take an
arbitrary number of values.

Except for these and the continuations created by
@func{call-with-values}, @func{let-values}, and @func{let*-values},
continuations implicitly accepting a single value, such as the
continuations of @meta{operator} and @meta{operand}s of procedure calls
or the @meta{test} expressions in conditionals, take exactly one value.
The effect of passing an inappropriate number of values to such a
continuation is undefined.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure call-with-values @var{producer} @var{consumer}
@var{producer} must be a procedure and should accept zero arguments.
@var{consumer} must be a procedure and should accept as many values as
@var{producer} returns.  The @func{call-with-values} procedure calls
@var{producer} with no arguments and a continuation that, when passed
some values, calls the @var{consumer} procedure with those values as
arguments.  The continuation for the call to @var{consumer} is the
continuation of the call to @func{call-with-values}.

@example
(call-with-values
    (lambda () (values 4 5))
  (lambda (a b) b))
=>  5

(call-with-values * -)
=>  -1
@end example

If a call to @code{call-with-values} occurs in a tail context, the call
to @var{consumer} is also in a tail context.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} After @var{producer} returns,
the implementation must check that @var{consumer} accepts as many values
as @var{consumer} has returned.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure dynamic-wind @var{before} @var{thunk} @var{after}
@var{before}, @var{thunk}, and @var{after} must be procedures, and each
should accept zero arguments.  These procedures may return any number of
values.

The @func{dynamic-wind} procedure calls @var{thunk} without arguments,
returning the results of this call.  Moreover, @func{dynamic-wind} calls
@var{before} without arguments whenever the dynamic extent of the call
to @var{thunk} is entered, and @var{after} without arguments whenever
the dynamic extent of the call to @var{thunk} is exited.  Thus, in the
absence of calls to escape procedures created by @func{call/cc},
@func{dynamic-wind} calls @var{before}, @var{thunk}, and @var{after}, in
that order.

While the calls to @var{before} and @var{after} are not considered to be
within the dynamic extent of the call to @var{thunk}, calls to the
@var{before} and @var{after} procedures of any other calls to
@func{dynamic-wind} that occur within the dynamic extent of the call to
@var{thunk} are considered to be within the dynamic extent of the call
to @var{thunk}.

More precisely, an escape procedure transfers control out of the dynamic
extent of a set of zero or more active @func{dynamic-wind} calls @emph{x
@dots{}} and transfer control into the dynamic extent of a set of zero
or more active @func{dynamic-wind} calls @emph{y @dots{}}.  It leaves
the dynamic extent of the most recent @emph{x} and calls without
arguments the corresponding @var{after} procedure.  If the @var{after}
procedure returns, the escape procedure proceeds to the next most recent
@emph{x}, and so on.  Once each @emph{x} has been handled in this
manner, the escape procedure calls without arguments the @var{before}
procedure corresponding to the least recent @emph{y}.  If the
@var{before} procedure returns, the escape procedure reenters the
dynamic extent of the least recent @emph{y} and proceeds with the next
least recent @emph{y}, and so on.  Once each @emph{y} has been handled
in this manner, control is transferred to the continuation packaged in
the escape procedure.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
the restrictions on @var{thunk} and @var{after} only if they are
actually called.

@example
(let ((path '())
      (c #f))
  (let ((add (lambda (s)
               (set! path (cons s path)))))
    (dynamic-wind
      (lambda () (add 'connect))
      (lambda ()
        (add (call-with-current-continuation
               (lambda (c0)
                 (set! c c0)
                 'talk1))))
      (lambda () (add 'disconnect)))
    (if (< (length path) 4)
        (c 'talk2)
        (reverse path))))
=> (connect talk1 disconnect connect talk2 disconnect)

(let ((n 0))
  (call-with-current-continuation
    (lambda (k)
      (dynamic-wind
        (lambda ()
          (set! n (+ n 1))
          (k))
        (lambda ()
          (set! n (+ n 2)))
        (lambda ()
          (set! n (+ n 4))))))
  n)
=> 1

(let ((n 0))
  (call-with-current-continuation
    (lambda (k)
      (dynamic-wind
        values
        (lambda ()

            values
            (lambda ()

              (k))))
        (lambda ()

@cindex Named let


@deffn Syntax let @meta{variable} @meta{bindings} @meta{body}
``Named @func{let}'' is a variant on the syntax of @func{let} that
provides a general looping construct and may also be used to express
recursion.  It has the same syntax and semantics as ordinary @func{let}
except that @meta{variable} is bound within @meta{body} to a procedure
whose parameters are the bound variables and whose body is @meta{body}.
Thus the execution of @meta{body} may be repeated by invoking the
procedure named by @meta{variable}.

@example
(let loop ((numbers '(3 -2 1 6 -5))
           (nonneg '())
           (neg '()))
  (cond ((null? numbers) (list nonneg neg))

@node baselib quasiquotation
@section Quasiquotation


@deffn Syntax quasiquote @meta{qq template}
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} unquote
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} unquote-splicing
``Backquote'' or ``quasiquote'' expressions are useful for constructing
a list or vector structure when some but not all of the desired
structure is known in advance.

@meta{qq template} should be as specified by the grammar at the end of
this entry.

If no @func{unquote} or @func{unquote-splicing} forms appear within the
@meta{qq template}, the result of evaluating @code{(quasiquote @meta{qq
template})} is equivalent to the result of evaluating @code{(quote
@meta{qq template})}.

If an @code{(unquote @meta{expression} @dots{})} form appears inside a
@meta{qq template}, however, the @meta{expression}s are evaluated
(``unquoted'') and their results are inserted into the structure instead
of the @code{unquote} form.

If an @code{(unquote-splicing @meta{expression} @dots{})} form appears
inside a @meta{qq template}, then the @meta{expression}s must evaluate
to lists; the opening and closing parentheses of the lists are then
``stripped away'' and the elements of the lists are inserted in place of
the @func{unquote-splicing} form.

Any @func{unquote-splicing} or multi--operand @func{unquote} form must
appear only within a list or vector @meta{qq template}.

The following abbreviations may be used:

@example
(quasiquote @meta{qq template})       =  `@meta{qq template}
(unquote @meta{expression})           =  ,@meta{expression}
(unquote-splicing @meta{expression})  =  ,@@@meta{expression}
@end example

Examples:

@example
`(list ,(+ 1 2) 4)                      => (list 3 4)

(let ((name 'a))
  `(list ,name ',name))                 => (list a (quote a))

`(a ,(+ 1 2) ,@@(map abs '(4 -5 6)) b)   => (a 3 4 5 6 b)

`((foo ,(- 10 3))
  ,@@(cdr '(c)) . ,(car '(cons)))        => ((foo 7) . cons)

`#(10 5 ,(sqrt 4) ,@@(map sqrt '(16 9)) 8)
                                        => #(10 5 2 4 3 8)

(let ((name 'foo))
  `((unquote name name name)))          => (foo foo foo)

(let ((name '(foo)))
  `((unquote-splicing name name name))) => (foo foo foo)

(let ((q '((append x y) (sqrt 9))))
  ``(foo ,,@@q))
=> `(foo (unquote (append x y) (sqrt 9)))

(let ((x '(2 3))
      (y '(4 5)))
  `(foo (unquote (append x y) (sqrt 9))))
=> (foo (2 3 4 5) 3)
@end example

Quasiquote forms may be nested.  Substitutions are made only for
unquoted components appearing at the same nesting level as the outermost
@func{quasiquote}.  The nesting level increases by one inside each
successive quasiquotation, and decreases by one inside each unquotation.

@example
`(a `(b ,(+ 1 2) ,(foo ,(+ 1 3) d) e) f)
=>  (a `(b ,(+ 1 2) ,(foo 4 d) e) f)

(let ((name1 'x)
      (name2 'y))
  `(a `(b ,,name1 ,',name2 d) e))
=>  (a `(b ,x ,'y d) e)
@end example

A @func{quasiquote} expression may return either fresh, mutable objects
or literal structure for any structure that is constructed at run time
during the evaluation of the expression.  Portions that do not need to
be rebuilt are always literal.  Thus:

@example
(let ((a 3))
  `((1 2) ,a ,4 ,'five 6))
@end example

@noindent
may be equivalent to either of the following expressions:

@example
'((1 2) 3 4 five 6)

(let ((a 3))
  (cons '(1 2)
        (cons a (cons 4 (cons 'five '(6))))))
@end example

However, it is not equivalent to this expression:

@example
(let ((a 3))
  (list (list 1 2) a 4 'five 6))
@end example

It is a syntax violation if any of the identifiers @func{quasiquote},
@func{unquote}, or @func{unquote-splicing} appear in positions within a
@meta{qq template} other than as described above.

The following grammar for quasiquote expressions is not context--free.
It is presented as a recipe for generating an infinite number of
production rules.  Imagine a copy of the following rules for @emph{D =
1, 2, 3, @dots{}}.  @emph{D} keeps track of the nesting depth.

@example
@meta{qq template} -> @meta{qq template 1}
@meta{qq template 0} -> @meta{expression}
@meta{quasiquotation @emph{D}} -> (quasiquote @meta{qq template @emph{D}})
@meta{qq template @emph{D}} -> @meta{lexeme datum}
    | @meta{list qq template @emph{D}}
    | @meta{vector qq template @emph{D}}
    | @meta{unquotation @emph{D}}
@meta{list qq template @emph{D}} -> (@arbno{@meta{qq template or splice @emph{D}}})
    | (@atleastone{@meta{qq template or splice @emph{D}}} . @meta{qq template @emph{D}})
    | @meta{quasiquotation @emph{D+1}}
@meta{vector qq template @emph{D}} -> #(@arbno{@meta{qq template or splice @emph{D}}})
@meta{unquotation @emph{D}} -> (unquote @meta{qq template @emph{D-1}})
@meta{qq template or splice @emph{D}} -> @meta{qq template @emph{D}}
    | @meta{splicing unquotation @emph{D}}
@meta{splicing unquotation @emph{D}} ->
      (unquote-splicing @arbno{@meta{qq template @emph{D-1}}})
    | (unquote @arbno{@meta{qq template @emph{D-1}}})
@end example

In @func{quasiquotation}s, a @meta{list qq template @emph{D}} can
sometimes be confused with either an @meta{unquotation @emph{D}} or a
@meta{splicing unquotation @emph{D}}.  The interpretation as an
@meta{unquotation} or @meta{splicing unquotation @emph{D}} takes
precedence.

@node baselib syntax binding
@section Binding constructs for syntactic keywords


@cindex Binding syntactic keywords
@cindex Syntactic keywords, binding


The @func{let-syntax} and @func{letrec-syntax} forms bind keywords.
Like a @func{begin} form, a @func{let-syntax} or @func{letrec-syntax}
form may appear in a definition context, in which case it is treated as
a definition, and the forms in the body must also be definitions.  A
@func{let-syntax} or @func{letrec-syntax} form may also appear in an
expression context, in which case the forms within their bodies must be
expressions.


@deffn Syntax let-syntax @meta{bindings} @meta{form} @dots{}
@meta{bindings} must have the form:

@example
((@meta{keyword} @meta{expression}) @dots{})
@end example

Each @meta{keyword} is an identifier, and each @meta{expression} is an
expression that evaluates, at macro--expansion time, to a
@emph{transformer}.  Transformers may be created by @func{syntax-rules}
or @func{identifier-syntax} or by one of the other mechanisms described
in library chapter ``@func{syntax-case}''.  It is a syntax violation for
@meta{keyword} to appear more than once in the list of keywords being
bound.

The @meta{form}s are expanded in the syntactic environment obtained by
extending the syntactic environment of the @func{let-syntax} form with
macros whose keywords are the @meta{keyword}s, bound to the specified
transformers.  Each binding of a @meta{keyword} has the @meta{form}s as
its region.

The @meta{form}s of a @func{let-syntax} form are treated, whether in
definition or expression context, as if wrapped in an implicit
@func{begin}.  Thus definitions in the result of expanding the
@meta{form}s have the same region as any definition appearing in place
of the @func{let-syntax} form would have.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation should
detect if the value of @meta{expression} cannot possibly be a
transformer.

@example
(let-syntax ([when (syntax-rules ()
                     ((when test stmt1 stmt2 ...)
                      (if test
                          (begin stmt1
                                 stmt2 ...))))])
  (let ([if #t])
    (when if (set! if 'now))
    if))
=>  now

(let ([x 'outer])
  (let-syntax ([m (syntax-rules () ((m) x))])
    (let ([x 'inner])
      (m))))
=>  outer

(let ()
  (let-syntax ([def (syntax-rules ()
                      [(def stuff ...) (define stuff ...)])])
    (def foo 42))
  foo)
=> 42

(let ()
  (let-syntax ())
  5)
=> 5
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax letrec-syntax @meta{bindings} @meta{form} @dots{}
Same as for @func{let-syntax}.

The @meta{form}s are expanded in the syntactic environment obtained by
extending the syntactic environment of the @func{letrec-syntax} form
with macros whose keywords are the @meta{keyword}s, bound to the
specified transformers.  Each binding of a @meta{keyword} has the
@meta{bindings} as well as the @meta{form}s within its region, so the
transformers can transcribe forms into uses of the macros introduced by
the @func{letrec-syntax} form.

The @meta{form}s of a @func{letrec-syntax} form are treated, whether in
definition or expression context, as if wrapped in an implicit
@func{begin}.  Thus definitions in the result of expanding the
@meta{form}s have the same region as any definition appearing in place
of the @func{letrec-syntax} form would have.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation should
detect if the value of @meta{expression} cannot possibly be a
transformer.

@example
(letrec-syntax
    ([my-or (syntax-rules ()
              [(my-or)    #f]
              [(my-or e)  e]
              [(my-or e1 e2 ...)  (let ([temp e1])
                                    (if temp
                                        temp
                                     (my-or e2 ...)))])])
  (let ([x      #f]
        [y      7]
        [temp   8]
        [let    odd?]
        [if     even?])
    (my-or x (let temp) (if y) y)))
=> 7
@end example

The following example highlights how @func{let-syntax} and
@func{letrec-syntax} differ.

                    [(f x) x])]

The two expressions are identical except that the @func{let-syntax} form
in the first expression is a @func{letrec-syntax} form in the second.
In the first expression, the @code{f} occurring in @code{g} refers to
the @func{let}-bound variable @code{f}, whereas in the second it refers
to the keyword @code{f} whose binding is established by the
@func{letrec-syntax} form.

@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax @code{(expand)}} _
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax @code{(expand)}} ...
Each @meta{literal} must be an identifier.  Each @meta{syntax rule} must
have the following form:

@example
(@meta{srpattern} @meta{template})
@end example

An @meta{srpattern} is a restricted form of @meta{pattern}, namely, a
nonempty @meta{pattern} in one of four parenthesized forms below whose
first subform is an identifier or an underscore @code{_}.  A
@meta{pattern} is an identifier, constant, or one of the following.

@example
(@meta{pattern} @dots{})
(@meta{pattern} @meta{pattern} @dots{} . @meta{pattern})
(@meta{pattern} @dots{} @meta{pattern} @meta{ellipsis} @meta{pattern} @dots{})
(@meta{pattern} @dots{} @meta{pattern} @meta{ellipsis} @meta{pattern} @dots{} . @meta{pattern})
#(@meta{pattern} @dots{})
#(@meta{pattern} @dots{} @meta{pattern} @meta{ellipsis} @meta{pattern} @dots{})
@end example

An @meta{ellipsis} is the identifier @code{...} (three periods).

A @meta{template} is a pattern variable, an identifier that is not a
pattern variable, a pattern datum, or one of the following.

@example
(@meta{subtemplate} @dots{})
(@meta{subtemplate} @dots{} . @meta{template})
#(@meta{subtemplate} @dots{})
@end example

A @meta{subtemplate} is a @meta{template} followed by zero or more
ellipses.

An instance of @func{syntax-rules} evaluates, at macro--expansion time,
to a new macro transformer by specifying a sequence of hygienic rewrite
rules.  A use of a macro whose keyword is associated with a transformer
specified by @func{syntax-rules} is matched against the patterns
contained in the @meta{syntax rule}s, beginning with the leftmost
@meta{syntax rule}.  When a match is found, the macro use is transcribed
hygienically according to the template.  It is a syntax violation when
no match is found.

An identifier appearing within a @meta{pattern} may be an underscore
(@code{_}), a literal identifier listed in the list of literals
@code{(@meta{literal} @dots{})}, or an ellipsis (@code{...}).  All other
identifiers appearing within a @meta{pattern} are @emph{pattern
variables}.  It is a syntax violation if an ellipsis or underscore
appears in @code{(@meta{literal} @dots{})}.

While the first subform of @meta{srpattern} may be an identifier, the
identifier is not involved in the matching and is not considered a
pattern variable or literal identifier.

Pattern variables match arbitrary input subforms and are used to refer
to elements of the input.  It is a syntax violation if the same pattern
variable appears more than once in a @meta{pattern}.

Underscores also match arbitrary input subforms but are not pattern
variables and so cannot be used to refer to those elements.  Multiple
underscores may appear in a @meta{pattern}.

A literal identifier matches an input subform if and only if the input
subform is an identifier and either both its occurrence in the input
expression and its occurrence in the list of literals have the same
lexical binding, or the two identifiers have the same name and both have
no lexical binding.

A subpattern followed by an ellipsis can match zero or more elements of
the input.

More formally, an input form @emph{F} matches a pattern @emph{P} if and
only if one of the following holds:

@itemize
@item
@emph{P} is an underscore (@code{_}).

@item
@emph{P} is a pattern variable.

@item
@emph{P} is a literal identifier and @emph{F} is an identifier such that
both @emph{P} and @emph{F} would refer to the same binding if both were
to appear in the output of the macro outside of any bindings inserted
into the output of the macro.  (If neither of two like--named
identifiers refers to any binding, i.e., both are undefined, they are
considered to refer to the same binding.)

@item
@emph{P} is of the form:

@example
(@emph{P_1} @dots{} @emph{P_n})
@end example

@noindent
and @emph{F} is a list of @emph{n} elements that match @emph{P_1}
through @emph{P_n}.

@item
@emph{P} is of the form:

@example
(@emph{P_1} @dots{} @emph{P_n} . @emph{P_x})
@end example

@noindent
and @emph{F} is a list or improper list of @emph{n} or more elements
whose first @emph{n} elements match @emph{P_1} through @emph{P_n} and
whose @emph{n}th cdr matches @emph{P_x}.

@item
@emph{P} is of the form:

@example
(@emph{P_1} @dots{} @emph{P_k} @emph{P_e} @meta{ellipsis} @emph{P_(m+1)} @dots{} @emph{P_n})
@end example

@noindent
where @meta{ellipsis} is the identifier @code{...}  and @emph{F} is a
list of @emph{n} elements whose first @emph{k} elements match @emph{P_1}
through @emph{P_k}, whose next @emph{m-k} elements each match
@emph{P_e}, and whose remaining @emph{n-m} elements match @emph{P_(m+1)}
through @emph{P_n}.

@item
@emph{P} is of the form:

@example
(@emph{P_1} @dots{} @emph{P_k} @emph{P_e} @meta{ellipsis} @emph{P_(m+1)} @dots{} @emph{P_n} . @emph{P_x})
@end example

@noindent
where @meta{ellipsis} is the identifier @code{...} and @emph{F} is a
list or improper list of @emph{n} elements whose first @emph{k} elements
match @emph{P_1} through @emph{P_k}, whose next @emph{m-k} elements each
match @emph{P_e}, whose next @emph{n-m} elements match @emph{P_(m+1)}
through @emph{P_n}, and whose @emph{n}th and final cdr matches
@emph{P_x}.

@item
@emph{P} is of the form:

@example
#(@emph{P_1} @dots{} @emph{P_n})
@end example

@noindent
and @emph{F} is a vector of @emph{n} elements that match @emph{P_1}
through @emph{P_n}.

@item
@emph{P} is of the form:

@example
#(@emph{P_1} @dots{} @emph{P_k} @emph{P_e} @meta{ellipsis} @emph{P_(m+1)} @dots{} @emph{P_n})
@end example

@noindent
where @meta{ellipsis} is the identifier @code{...} and @emph{F} is a
vector of @emph{n} or more elements whose first @emph{k} elements match
@emph{P_1} through @emph{P_k}, whose next @emph{m-k} elements each match
@emph{P_e}, and whose remaining @emph{n-m} elements match @emph{P_(m+1)}
through @emph{P_n}.

@item
@emph{P} is a pattern datum (any nonlist, nonvector, nonsymbol datum)
and @emph{F} is equal to @emph{P} in the sense of the @func{equal?}
procedure.
@end itemize

When a macro use is transcribed according to the template of the
matching @meta{syntax rule}, pattern variables that occur in the
template are replaced by the subforms they match in the input.

Pattern data and identifiers that are not pattern variables or ellipses
are copied into the output.  A subtemplate followed by an ellipsis
expands into zero or more occurrences of the subtemplate.  Pattern
variables that occur in subpatterns followed by one or more ellipses may
occur only in subtemplates that are followed by (at least) as many
ellipses.  These pattern variables are replaced in the output by the
input subforms to which they are bound, distributed as specified.  If a
pattern variable is followed by more ellipses in the subtemplate than in
the associated subpattern, the input form is replicated as necessary.
The subtemplate must contain at least one pattern variable from a
subpattern followed by an ellipsis, and for at least one such pattern
variable, the subtemplate must be followed by exactly as many ellipses
as the subpattern in which the pattern variable appears.  (Otherwise,
the expander would not be able to determine how many times the subform
should be repeated in the output.)  It is a syntax violation if the
constraints of this paragraph are not met.

A template of the form @code{(@meta{ellipsis} @meta{template})} is
identical to @meta{template}, except that ellipses within the template
have no special meaning.  That is, any ellipses contained within
@meta{template} are treated as ordinary identifiers.  In particular, the
template @code{(... ...)} produces a single ellipsis, @code{...}.  This
allows syntactic abstractions to expand into forms containing ellipses.

@example
(define-syntax be-like-begin
  (syntax-rules ()
    [(be-like-begin name)
     (define-syntax name
       (syntax-rules ()
         ((name expr (... ...))
          (begin expr (... ...)))))]))

(be-like-begin sequence)
(sequence 1 2 3 4) => 4
@end example

As an example for hygienic use of auxiliary identifier, if @func{let}
and @func{cond} are defined as in @ref{baselib expressions binding} and
@ref{lang derived} then they are hygienic (as required) and the
following is not an error.

@example
(let ((=> #f))
  (cond (#t => 'ok)))           => ok
@end example

The macro transformer for @func{cond} recognizes @code{=>} as a local
variable, and hence an expression, and not as the identifier @code{=>},
which the macro transformer treats as a syntactic keyword.  Thus the
example expands into:

@example
(let ((=> #f))
  (if #t (begin => 'ok)))
@end example

@noindent
instead of:

@example
(let ((=> #f))
  (let ((temp #t))
    (if temp ('ok temp))))
@end example

@noindent
which would result in an assertion violation.
@end deffn


@deffn {Syntax @code{(expand)}} identifier-syntax @meta{template}
@deffnx {Syntax @code{(expand)}} identifier-syntax (@hyperi{id} @metai{template}) ((set! @hyperii{id} @meta{pattern}) @hyperii{template})
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax @code{(expand)}} set!
The @meta{id}s must be identifiers.  The @meta{template}s must be as for
@func{syntax-rules}.

When a keyword is bound to a transformer produced by the first form of
@func{identifier-syntax}, references to the keyword within the scope of
the binding are replaced by @meta{template}.

@example
(define p (cons 4 5))
(define-syntax p.car (identifier-syntax (car p)))
p.car => 4
(set! p.car 15) => exception &syntax
@end example

The second, more general, form of @func{identifier-syntax} permits the
transformer to determine what happens when @code{set!} is used.  In this
case, uses of the identifier by itself are replaced by
@hyperi{template}, and uses of @code{set!} with the identifier are
replaced by @hyperii{template}.

@example
(define p (cons 4 5))
(define-syntax p.car
  (identifier-syntax
    [_ (car p)]
    [(set! _ e) (set-car! p e)]))
(set! p.car 15)
p.car           => 15
p               => (15 . 5)

@node baselib tail call
@section Tail calls and tail contexts


@cindex Tail call
@cindex Tail contexts


A @emph{tail call} is a procedure call that occurs in a @emph{tail
context}.  Tail contexts are defined inductively.  Note that a tail
context is always determined with respect to a particular lambda
expression.

@itemize
@item
The last expression within the body of a lambda expression, shown as
@meta{tail expression} below, occurs in a tail context.

@example
(lambda @meta{formals}
  @arbno{@meta{definition}}
  @arbno{@meta{expression}} @meta{tail expression})
@end example

@item
If one of the following expressions is in a tail context, then the
subexpressions shown as @meta{tail expression} are in a tail context.
These were derived from specifications of the syntax of the forms
described in this chapter by replacing some occurrences of
@meta{expression} with @meta{tail expression}.  Only those rules that
contain tail contexts are shown here.

@example
(if @meta{expression} @meta{tail expression} @meta{tail expression})
(if @meta{expression} @meta{tail expression})

(cond @atleastone{@meta{cond clause}})
(cond @arbno{@meta{cond clause}} (else @meta{tail sequence}))

(case @meta{expression}
  @atleastone{@meta{case clause}})
(case @meta{expression}
  @arbno{@meta{case clause}}
  (else @meta{tail sequence}))

(and @arbno{@meta{expression}} @meta{tail expression})
(or @arbno{@meta{expression}} @meta{tail expression})

(let @meta{bindings} @meta{tail body})
(let @meta{variable} @meta{bindings} @meta{tail body})
(let* @meta{bindings} @meta{tail body})
(letrec* @meta{bindings} @meta{tail body})
(letrec @meta{bindings} @meta{tail body})
(let-values @meta{mv-bindings} @meta{tail body})
(let*-values @meta{mv-bindings} @meta{tail body})

(let-syntax @meta{bindings} @meta{tail body})
(letrec-syntax @meta{bindings} @meta{tail body})

(begin @meta{tail sequence})
@end example

A @meta{cond clause} is:

@example
(@meta{test} @meta{tail sequence})
@end example

@noindent
a @meta{case clause} is:

@example
((@arbno{@meta{datum}}) @meta{tail sequence})
@end example

@noindent
a @meta{tail body} is:

@example
@arbno{@meta{definition}} @meta{tail sequence}
@end example

@noindent
and a @meta{tail sequence} is:

@example
@arbno{@meta{expression}} @meta{tail expression}
@end example

@item
If a @func{cond} expression is in a tail context, and has a clause of
the form @code{(@hyperi{expression} => @hyperii{expression})} then the
(implied) call to the procedure that results from the evaluation of
@hyperii{expression} is in a tail context.  @hyperii{expression} itself
is not in a tail context.
@end itemize

Certain built--in procedures must also perform tail calls.  The first
argument passed to @func{apply} and to @func{call/cc}, and the second
argument passed to @func{call-with-values}, must be called via a tail
call.

In the following example the only tail call is the call to @func{f}.
None of the calls to @func{g} or @func{h} are tail calls.  The reference
to @code{x} is in a tail context, but it is not a call and thus is not a
tail call.

@example
(lambda ()
  (if (g)
      (let ((x (h)))
        x)
      (and (g) (f))))
@end example

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Implementations may recognize that some non--tail calls,
such as the call to @func{h} above, can be evaluated as though they were
tail calls.  In the example above, the @func{let} expression could be
compiled as a tail call to @func{h}.  (The possibility of @func{h}
returning an unexpected number of values can be ignored, because in that
case the effect of the @func{let} is explicitly unspecified and
implementation--dependent.)

The procedures exported by the @rsixlibrary{unicode} library provide
access to some aspects of the Unicode semantics for characters and
strings: category information, case--independent comparisons, case
mappings, and normalization.

Some of the procedures that operate on characters or strings ignore the
difference between upper case and lower case.  These procedures have
@code{-ci} (for ``case insensitive'') embedded in their names.

@deffn Procedure char-upcase @var{char}
@deffnx Procedure char-downcase @var{char}
@deffnx Procedure char-titlecase @var{char}
@deffnx Procedure char-foldcase @var{char}
These procedures take a character argument and return a character
result.

If the argument is an upper--case or title--case character, and if there
is a single character that is its lower--case form, then
@func{char-downcase} returns that character.

If the argument is a lower--case or title--case character, and there is
a single character that is its upper--case form, then @func{char-upcase}
returns that character.

If the argument is a lower--case or upper--case character, and there is
a single character that is its title--case form, then
@func{char-titlecase} returns that character.

If the argument is not a title--case character and there is no single
character that is its title--case form, then @func{char-titlecase}
returns the upper--case form of the argument.

Finally, if the character has a case--folded character, then
@func{char-foldcase} returns that character.  Otherwise the character
returned is the same as the argument.

For Turkic characters @code{#\x130} and @code{#\x131},
@func{char-foldcase} behaves as the identity function; otherwise
@func{char-foldcase} is the same as @func{char-downcase} composed with
@func{char-upcase}.

@example
(char-upcase #\i)               => #\I
(char-downcase #\i)             => #\i
(char-titlecase #\i)            => #\I
(char-foldcase #\i)             => #\i
@end example

@quotation
@emph{Note:} @func{char-titlecase} does not always return a title--case
character.
@end quotation

@quotation
@emph{Note:} These procedures are consistent with Unicode's
locale--independent mappings from scalar values to scalar values for
upcase, downcase, titlecase, and case--folding operations.  These
mappings can be extracted from @file{UnicodeData.txt} and
@file{CaseFolding.txt} from the Unicode Consortium, ignoring Turkic
mappings in the latter.

Note that these character--based procedures are an incomplete
approximation to case conversion, even ignoring the user's locale.  In
general, case mappings require the context of a string, both in
arguments and in result.  The @func{string-upcase},
@func{string-downcase}, @func{string-titlecase}, and
@func{string-foldcase} procedures (@ref{stdlib unicode strings} perform
more general case conversion.

@deffnx Procedure char-ci>=? @vari{char} @varii{char} @variii{char} @dots{}
These procedures are similar to @func{char=?}, etc., but operate on the
case--folded versions of the characters.

@example

@deffnx Procedure char-upper-case? @var{char}
@deffnx Procedure char-lower-case? @var{char}
@deffnx Procedure char-title-case? @var{char}
These procedures return @true{} if their arguments are alphabetic,
numeric, whitespace, upper--case, lower--case, or title--case
characters, respectively; otherwise they return @false{}.

A character is alphabetic if it has the Unicode ``Alphabetic'' property.
A character is numeric if it has the Unicode ``Numeric'' property.  A
character is whitespace if has the Unicode ``White_Space'' property.  A
character is upper case if it has the Unicode ``Uppercase'' property,
lower case if it has the ``Lowercase'' property, and title case if it is
in the Lt general category.

@deffn Procedure string-upcase @var{string}
@deffnx Procedure string-downcase @var{string}
@deffnx Procedure string-titlecase @var{string}
@deffnx Procedure string-foldcase @var{string}
These procedures take a string argument and return a string result.
They are defined in terms of Unicode's locale--independent case mappings
from Unicode scalar--value sequences to scalar--value sequences.  In
particular, the length of the result string can be different from the
length of the input string.  When the specified result is equal in the
sense of @func{string=?} to the argument, these procedures may return
the argument instead of a newly allocated string.

The @func{string-upcase} procedure converts a string to upper case;
@func{string-downcase} converts a string to lower case.  The
@func{string-foldcase} procedure converts the string to its case--folded
counterpart, using the full case--folding mapping, but without the
special mappings for Turkic languages.  The @func{string-titlecase}
procedure converts the first cased character of each word, and downcases
all other cased characters.

@example
(string-upcase "Hi")                    => "HI"
(string-downcase "Hi")                  => "hi"
(string-foldcase "Hi")                  => "hi"

(string-titlecase "kNock KNoCK")        => "Knock Knock"
(string-titlecase "who's there?")       => "Who's There?"
(string-titlecase "r6rs")               => "R6rs"
(string-titlecase "R6RS")               => "R6rs"
@end example

@quotation
@emph{Note:} The case mappings needed for implementing these procedures
can be extracted from @file{UnicodeData.txt}, @file{SpecialCasing.txt},
@file{WordBreakProperty.txt} (the ``MidLetter'' property partly defines
case--ignorable characters), and @file{CaseFolding.txt} from the Unicode
Consortium.

Since these procedures are locale--independent, they may not be
appropriate for some locales.

@chapter Bytevectors


Many applications deal with blocks of binary data by accessing them in
various ways---extracting signed or unsigned numbers of various sizes.
Therefore, the @rsixlibrary{bytevectors} library provides a single type
for blocks of binary data with multiple ways to access that data. It
deals with integers and floating--point representations in various sizes
with specified endianness.

Bytevectors are objects of a disjoint type.  Conceptually, a bytevector
represents a sequence of 8-bit bytes.  The description of bytevectors
uses the term @emph{byte} for an exact integer object in the interval
@code{(-128, @dots{}, 127)} and the term @emph{octet} for an exact
integer object in the interval @code{(0, @dots{}, 255)}.  A byte
corresponds to its two's complement representation as an octet.

The length of a bytevector is the number of bytes it contains. This
number is fixed.  A valid index into a bytevector is an exact,
non--negative integer object less than the length of the bytevector.
The first byte of a bytevector has index 0; the last byte has an index
one less than the length of the bytevector.

Generally, the access procedures come in different flavors according to
the size of the represented integer and the endianness of the
representation.  The procedures also distinguish signed and unsigned
representations.  The signed representations all use two's complement.

Like string literals, literals representing bytevectors do not need to
be quoted:

@example
#vu8(12 23 123) => #vu8(12 23 123)
@end example

@section Endianness


Many operations described in this chapter accept an @emph{endianness}
argument.  Endianness describes the encoding of exact integer objects as
several contiguous bytes in a bytevector.  For this purpose, the binary
representation of the integer object is split into consecutive bytes.
The little--endian encoding places the least significant byte of an
integer first, with the other bytes following in increasing order of
significance.  The big--endian encoding places the most significant byte
of an integer first, with the other bytes following in decreasing order
of significance.

This terminology also applies to @ieee{} 754 numbers: @ieee{} 754
describes how to represent a floating--point number as an exact integer
object, and endianness describes how the bytes of such an integer are
laid out in a bytevector.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Little-- and big--endianness are only the most common kinds
of endianness.  Some architectures distinguish between the endianness at
different levels of a binary representation.

@deffn Syntax endianness @meta{endianness symbol}
The name of @meta{endianness symbol} must be a symbol describing an
endianness.  An implementation must support at least the symbols
@code{big} and @code{little}, but may support other endianness symbols.

@code{(endianness @meta{endianness symbol})} evaluates to the symbol
named @meta{endianness symbol}.  Whenever one of the procedures
operating on bytevectors accepts an endianness as an argument, that
argument must be one of these symbols.  It is a syntax violation for
@meta{endianness symbol} to be anything other than an endianness symbol
supported by the implementation.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Implementors should use widely accepted designations for
endianness symbols other than @code{big} and @code{little}.

@emph{Note:} Only the name of @meta{endianness symbol} is significant.

@deffn Procedure native-endianness
Return the endianness symbol associated implementation's preferred
endianness (usually that of the underlying machine architecture).  This
may be any @meta{endianness symbol}, including a symbol other than
@code{big} and @code{little}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure bytevector? @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a bytevector, @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure make-bytevector @var{k}
@deffnx Procedure make-bytevector @var{k} @var{fill}
Return a newly allocated bytevector of @var{k} bytes.  If the @var{fill}
argument is missing, the initial contents of the returned bytevector are
unspecified.  If the @var{fill} argument is present, it must be an exact
integer object in the interval @code{(-128, @dots{} 255)} that specifies
the initial value for the bytes of the bytevector: If @var{fill} is
positive, it is interpreted as an octet; if it is negative, it is
interpreted as a byte.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure bytevector-length @var{bytevector}
Return, as an exact integer object, the number of bytes in
@var{bytevector}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {bytevector=?} @vari{bytevector} @varii{bytevector}
Return @true{} if @vari{bytevector} and @varii{bytevector} are equal;
that is, if they have the same length and equal bytes at all valid
indices.  It returns @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {bytevector-fill!} @var{bytevector} @var{fill}
The @var{fill} argument is as in the description of the
@func{make-bytevector} procedure.  The @func{bytevector-fill!}
procedure stores @var{fill} in every element of @var{bytevector} and
returns unspecified values.  Analogous to @func{vector-fill!}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {bytevector-copy!} @var{source} @var{source-start} @var{target} @var{target-start} @var{k}
@var{source} and @var{target} must be bytevectors.  @var{source-start},
@var{target-start}, and @var{k} must be non--negative exact integer
objects that satisfy:

@example
0 <= @var{source-start} <= @var{source-start} + @var{k} <= l_@var{source}
0 <= @var{target-start} <= @var{target-start} + @var{k} <= l_@var{target}
@end example

@noindent
where @emph{l_@var{source}} is the length of @var{source} and
@emph{l_@var{target}} is the length of @var{target}.

The @func{bytevector-copy!} procedure copies the bytes from @var{source}
at indices:

@example
@var{source-start}, @dots{}, @var{source-start} + @var{k} - 1
@end example

@noindent
to consecutive indices in @var{target} starting at @var{target-index}.

This must work even if the memory regions for the source and the target
overlap, i.e., the bytes at the target location after the copy must be
equal to the bytes at the source location before the copy.

This returns unspecified values.

@example
(let ((b (u8-list->bytevector '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8))))
  (bytevector-copy! b 0 b 3 4)
  (bytevector->u8-list b))

@section Operations on strings


This section describes procedures that convert between strings and
bytevectors containing Unicode encodings of those strings.  When
decoding bytevectors, encoding errors are handled as with the
@code{replace} semantics of textual I/O: If an invalid or incomplete
character encoding is encountered, then the replacement character
@code{U+FFFD} is appended to the string being generated, an appropriate
number of bytes are ignored, and decoding continues with the following
bytes.


@deffn Procedure string->utf8 @var{string}
Return a newly allocated (unless empty) bytevector that contains the
@utf{}-8 encoding of the given string.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure string->utf16 @var{string}
@deffnx Procedure string->utf16 @var{string} @var{endianness}
If @var{endianness} is specified, it must be the symbol @code{big} or
the symbol @code{little}.  The @func{string->utf16} procedure returns a
newly allocated (unless empty) bytevector that contains the @utf{}-16BE
or @utf{}-16LE encoding of the given string (with no byte--order mark).
If endianness is not specified or is @code{big}, then @utf{}-16BE is
used.  If endianness is @code{little}, then @utf{}-16LE is used.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure string->utf32 @var{string}
@deffnx Procedure string->utf32 @var{string} @var{endianness}
If @var{endianness} is specified, it must be the symbol @code{big} or
the symbol @code{little}.  The @func{string->utf32} procedure returns a
newly allocated (unless empty) bytevector that contains the @utf{}-32BE
or @utf{}-32LE encoding of the given string (with no byte mark).  If
endianness is not specified or is @code{big}, then @utf{}-32BE is used.
If endianness is @code{little}, then @utf{}-32LE is used.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure utf8->string @var{bytevector}
Return a newly allocated (unless empty) string whose character sequence
is encoded by the given bytevector.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure utf16->string @var{bytevector} @var{endianness}
@deffnx Procedure utf16->string @var{bytevector} @var{endianness} @var{endianness-mandatory}
@var{endianness} must be the symbol @code{big} or the symbol
@code{little}.

The @func{utf16->string} procedure returns a newly allocated (unless
empty) string whose character sequence is encoded by the given
bytevector.

@var{bytevector} is decoded according to @utf{}-16, @utf{}-16BE,
@utf{}-16LE, or a fourth encoding scheme that differs from all three of
those as follows: If @var{endianness-mandatory} is absent or @false{},
@func{utf16->string} determines the endianness according to a @utf{}-16
BOM at the beginning of @var{bytevector} if a BOM is present; in this
case, the BOM is not decoded as a character.  Also in this case, if no
@utf{}-16 BOM is present, @var{endianness} specifies the endianness of
the encoding.  If @var{endianness-mandatory} is a true value,
@var{endianness} specifies the endianness of the encoding, and any
@utf{}-16 BOM in the encoding is decoded as a regular character.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} A @utf{}-16 BOM is either a sequence of bytes @code{#xFE},
@code{#xFF} specifying @code{big} and @utf{}-16BE, or @code{#xFF},
@code{#xFE} specifying @code{little} and @utf{}-16LE.
@end quotation
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure utf32->string @var{bytevector} @var{endianness}
@deffnx Procedure utf32->string @var{bytevector} @var{endianness} @var{endianness-mandatory}
@var{endianness} must be the symbol @code{big} or the symbol
@code{little}.

The @func{utf32->string} procedure returns a newly allocated (unless
empty) string whose character sequence is encoded by the given
bytevector.

@var{bytevector} is decoded according to @utf{}-32, @utf{}-32BE,
@utf{}-32LE, or a fourth encoding scheme that differs from all three of
those as follows: If @var{endianness-mandatory} is absent or @false{},
@func{utf32->string} determines the endianness according to a @utf{}-32
BOM at the beginning of @var{bytevector} if a BOM is present; in this
case, the BOM is not decoded as a character.  Also in this case, if no
@utf{}-32 BOM is present, @var{endianness} specifies the endianness of
the encoding.  If @var{endianness-mandatory} is a true value,
@var{endianness} specifies the endianness of the encoding, and any
@utf{}-32 BOM in the encoding is decoded as a regular character.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} A @utf{}-32 BOM is either a sequence of bytes @code{#x00},
@code{#x00}, @code{#xFE}, @code{#xFF} specifying @code{big} and
@utf{}-32BE, or @code{#xFF}, @code{#xFE}, @code{#x00}, @code{#x00},
specifying @code{little} and @utf{}-32LE.

@node stdlib list
@chapter List utilities


This chapter describes the @rsixlibrary{lists} library, which contains
various useful procedures that operate on lists.


@deffn Procedure find @var{proc} @var{list}
@var{proc} should accept one argument and return a single value.
@var{proc} should not mutate @var{list}.  The @func{find} procedure
applies @var{proc} to the elements of @var{list} in order.  If
@var{proc} returns a true value for an element, @func{find} immediately
returns that element.  If @var{proc} returns @false{} for all elements
of the list, @func{find} returns @false{}.  @var{proc} is always called
in the same dynamic environment as @func{find} itself.

@example
(find even? '(3 1 4 1 5 9))             => 4
(find even? '(3 1 5 1 5 9))             => #f
@end example

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
that @var{list} is a chain of pairs up to the found element, or that it
is indeed a list if no element is found.  It should not check that it is
a chain of pairs beyond the found element.  The implementation must
check the restrictions on @var{proc} to the extent performed by applying
it as described.  An implementation may check whether @var{proc} is an
appropriate argument before applying it.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure for-all @var{proc} @vari{list} @varii{list} @dots{} @varn{list}
@deffnx Procedure exists @var{proc} @vari{list} @varii{list} @dots{} @varn{list}
The @var{list}s should all have the same length, and @var{proc} should
accept @emph{n} arguments and return a single value.  @var{proc} should
not mutate the @var{list} arguments.

For natural numbers @emph{i} = 0, 1, @dots{}, the @func{for-all}
procedure successively applies @var{proc} to arguments @emph{x_i^1
@dots{} x_i^n}, where @emph{x_i^j} is the @emph{i}th element of
@var{listj}, until @false{} is returned.

If @var{proc} returns true values for all but the last element of
@vari{list}, @func{for-all} performs a tail call of @var{proc} on the
@emph{k}th elements, where @emph{k} is the length of @vari{list}.  If
@var{proc} returns @false{} on any set of elements, @func{for-all}
returns @false{} after the first such application of @var{proc}.  If the
@var{list}s are all empty, @func{for-all} returns @true{}.

For natural numbers @emph{i} = 0, 1, @dots{}, the @func{exists}
procedure applies @var{proc} successively to arguments @emph{x_i^1}
@dots{} @emph{x_i^n}, where @emph{x_i^j} is the @emph{i}th element of
@var{listj}, until a true value is returned.

If @var{proc} returns @false{} for all but the last elements of the
@var{list}s, @code{exists} performs a tail call of @var{proc} on the
@emph{k}th elements, where @emph{k} is the length of @vari{list}.  If
@var{proc} returns a true value on any set of elements, @code{ exists}
returns that value after the first such application of @var{proc}.  If
the @var{list}s are all empty, @code{exists} returns @false{}.

@var{proc} is always called in the same dynamic environment as
@func{for-all} or, respectively, @func{exists} itself.

@example
(for-all even? '(3 1 4 1 5 9))          => #f
(for-all even? '(3 1 4 1 5 9 . 2))      => #f
(for-all even? '(2 4 14))               => #t
(for-all even? '(2 4 14 . 9))           => exception &assertion
(for-all (lambda (n) (and (even? n) n))
         '(2 4 14))                     => 14
(for-all < '(1 2 3) '(2 3 4))           => #t
(for-all < '(1 2 4) '(2 3 4))           => #f

(exists even? '(3 1 4 1 5 9))           => #t
(exists even? '(3 1 1 5 9))             => #f
(exists even? '(3 1 1 5 9 . 2))         => exception &assertion
(exists (lambda (n) (and (even? n) n))
        '(2 1 4 14))                    => 2
(exists < '(1 2 4) '(2 3 4))            => #t
(exists > '(1 2 3) '(2 3 4))            => #f
@end example

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
that the @var{list}s are chains of pairs to the extent necessary to
determine the return value.  If this requires traversing the lists
entirely, the implementation should check that the @var{list}s all have
the same length.  If not, it should not check that the @var{list}s are
chains of pairs beyond the traversal.  The implementation must check the
restrictions on @var{proc} to the extent performed by applying it as
described.  An implementation may check whether @var{proc} is an
appropriate argument before applying it.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure filter @var{proc} @var{list}
@deffnx Procedure partition @var{proc} @var{list}
@var{proc} should accept one argument and return a single value.
@var{proc} should not mutate @var{list}.

The @func{filter} procedure applies @var{proc} to each element of
@var{list} and returns a list of the elements of @var{list} for which
@var{proc} returned a true value.

The @func{partition} procedure also applies @var{proc} to each element
of @var{list}, but returns two values, the first one a list of the
elements of @var{list} for which @var{proc} returned a true value, and
the second a list of the elements of @var{list} for which @var{proc}
returned @false{}.

In both cases, the elements of the result list(s) are in the same order
as they appear in the input list.  @var{proc} is always called in the
same dynamic environment as @func{filter} or, respectively,
@func{partition} itself.  If multiple returns occur from @func{filter}
or @func{partitions}, the return values returned by earlier returns are
not mutated.

@example
(filter even? '(3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6))       => (4 2 6)

(partition even? '(3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6))    => (4 2 6) (3 1 1 5 9)
                                           ; two values
@end example

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
the restrictions on @var{proc} to the extent performed by applying it as
described.  An implementation may check whether @var{proc} is an
appropriate argument before applying it.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure fold-left @var{combine} @var{nil} @vari{list} @varii{list} @dots{} @varn{list}
The @var{list}s should all have the same length.  @var{combine} must be
a procedure; it should accept one more argument than there are
@var{list}s and return a single value; it should not mutate the
@var{list} arguments.

The @func{fold-left} procedure iterates the @var{combine} procedure over
an accumulator value and the elements of the @var{list}s from left to
right, starting with an accumulator value of @var{nil}.

More specifically, @func{fold-left} returns @var{nil} if the @var{list}s
are empty.  If they are not empty, @var{combine} is first applied to
@var{nil} and the respective first elements of the @var{list}s in order.
The result becomes the new accumulator value, and @var{combine} is
applied to the new accumulator value and the respective next elements of
the @var{list}.  This step is repeated until the end of the list is
reached; then the accumulator value is returned.

@var{combine} is always called in the same dynamic environment as
@func{fold-left} itself.

@example
(fold-left + 0 '(1 2 3 4 5))            => 15

(fold-left (lambda (a e)
             (cons e a))
           '()
           '(1 2 3 4 5))                => (5 4 3 2 1)

(fold-left (lambda (count x)
             (if (odd? x)
                 (+ count 1)
               count))
           0
           '(3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3))      => 7

(fold-left (lambda (max-len s)
             (max max-len (string-length s)))
           0
           '("longest" "long" "longer"))
                                        => 7

(fold-left cons '(q) '(a b c))          => ((((q) . a) . b) . c)

(fold-left + 0 '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))       => 21
@end example

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation should
check that the @var{list}s all have the same length.  The implementation
must check the restrictions on @var{combine} to the extent performed by
applying it as described.  An implementation may check whether
@var{combine} is an appropriate argument before applying it.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure fold-right @var{combine} @var{nil} @vari{list} @varii{list} @dots{} @varn{list}
The @var{list}s should all have the same length.  @var{combine} must be
a procedure; it should accept one more argument than there are
@var{list}s and return a single value; @var{combine} should not mutate
the @var{list} arguments.

The @func{fold-right} procedure iterates the @var{combine} procedure
over the elements of the @var{list}s from right to left and an
accumulator value, starting with an accumulator value of @var{nil}.

More specifically, @func{fold-right} returns @var{nil} if the
@var{list}s are empty.  If they are not empty, @var{combine} is first
applied to the respective last elements of the @var{list}s in order and
@var{nil}.  The result becomes the new accumulator value, and
@var{combine} is applied to the respective previous elements of the
@var{list}s and the new accumulator value.  This step is repeated until
the beginning of the list is reached; then the accumulator value is
returned.

@var{proc} is always called in the same dynamic environment as
@func{fold-right} itself.

@example
(fold-right + 0 '(1 2 3 4 5))                   => 15

(fold-right cons '() '(1 2 3 4 5))              => (1 2 3 4 5)

(fold-right (lambda (x l)
              (if (odd? x) (cons x l) l))
            '()
            '(3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5))
                                                => (3 1 1 5 9 5)

(fold-right cons '(q) '(a b c))                 => (a b c q)

(fold-right + 0 '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))              => 21
@end example

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation should
check that the @var{list}s all have the same length.  The implementation
must check the restrictions on @var{combine} to the extent performed by
applying it as described.  An implementation may check whether
@var{combine} is an appropriate argument before applying it.

@deffn Procedure remp @var{proc} @var{list}
@deffnx Procedure remove @var{obj} @var{list}
@deffnx Procedure remv @var{obj} @var{list}
@deffnx Procedure remq @var{obj} @var{list}
@var{proc} should accept one argument and return a single value.
@var{proc} should not mutate @var{list}.

Each of these procedures returns a list of the elements of @var{list}
that do not satisfy a given condition.

The @func{remp} procedure applies @var{proc} to each element of
@var{list} and returns a list of the elements of @var{list} for which
@var{proc} returned @false{}.  @var{proc} is always called in the same
dynamic environment as @func{remp} itself.

The @func{remove}, @func{remv}, and @func{remq} procedures return a list
of the elements that are not @var{obj}.  The @func{remq} procedure uses
@func{eq?} to compare @var{obj} with the elements of @var{list}, while
@func{remv} uses @func{eqv?} and @func{remove} uses @func{equal?}.

The elements of the result list are in the same order as they appear in
the input list.  If multiple returns occur from @func{remp}, the return
values returned by earlier returns are not mutated.

@example
(remp even? '(3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5))       => (3 1 1 5 9 5)

(remove 1 '(3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5))         => (3 4 5 9 2 6 5)

(remv 1 '(3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5))           => (3 4 5 9 2 6 5)

(remq 'foo '(bar foo baz))              => (bar baz)
@end example

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
the restrictions on @var{proc} to the extent performed by applying it as
described.  An implementation may check whether @var{proc} is an
appropriate argument before applying it.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure memp @var{proc} @var{list}
@deffnx Procedure member @var{obj} @var{list}
@deffnx Procedure memv @var{obj} @var{list}
@deffnx Procedure memq @var{obj} @var{list}
@var{proc} should accept one argument and return a single value.
@var{proc} should not mutate @var{list}.

These procedures return the first sublist of @var{list} whose car
satisfies a given condition, where the sublists of @var{lists} are the
lists returned by @code{(list-tail @var{list} @var{k})} for @var{k} less
than the length of @var{list}.

The @func{memp} procedure applies @var{proc} to the cars of the sublists
of @var{list} until it finds one for which @var{proc} returns a true
value.  @var{proc} is always called in the same dynamic environment as
@func{memp} itself.

The @func{member}, @func{memv}, and @func{memq} procedures look for the
first occurrence of @var{obj}.  If @var{list} does not contain an
element satisfying the condition, then @false{} (not the empty list) is
returned.  The @func{member} procedure uses @func{equal?} to compare
@var{obj} with the elements of @var{list}, while @func{memv} uses
@func{eqv?} and @func{memq} uses @func{eq?}.

@example
(memp even? '(3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5))       => (4 1 5 9 2 6 5)

(memq 'a '(a b c))                      => (a b c)
(memq 'b '(a b c))                      => (b c)
(memq 'a '(b c d))                      => #f
(memq (list 'a) '(b (a) c))             => #f
(member (list 'a) '(b (a) c))           => ((a) c)
(memq 101 '(100 101 102))               => unspecified
(memv 101 '(100 101 102))               => (101 102)
@end example

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
that @var{list} is a chain of pairs up to the found element, or that it
is indeed a list if no element is found.  It should not check that it is
a chain of pairs beyond the found element.  The implementation must
check the restrictions on @var{proc} to the extent performed by applying
it as described.  An implementation may check whether @var{proc} is an
appropriate argument before applying it.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure assp @var{proc} @var{alist}
@deffnx Procedure assoc @var{obj} @var{alist}
@deffnx Procedure assv @var{obj} @var{alist}
@deffnx Procedure assq @var{obj} @var{alist}
@var{alist} (for ``association list'') should be a list of pairs.
@var{proc} should accept one argument and return a single value.
@var{Proc} should not mutate @var{alist}.

These procedures find the first pair in @var{alist} whose car field
satisfies a given condition, and returns that pair without traversing
@var{alist} further.  If no pair in @var{alist} satisfies the condition,
then @false{} is returned.

The @func{assp} procedure successively applies @var{proc} to the car
fields of @var{alist} and looks for a pair for which it returns a true
value.  @var{proc} is always called in the same dynamic environment as
@func{assp} itself.

The @func{assoc}, @func{assv}, and @func{assq} procedures look for a
pair that has @var{obj} as its car.  The @func{assoc} procedure uses
@func{equal?} to compare @var{obj} with the car fields of the pairs in
@var{alist}, while @func{assv} uses @func{eqv?} and @func{assq} uses
@func{eq?}.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
that @var{alist} is a chain of pairs containing pairs up to the found
pair, or that it is indeed a list of pairs if no element is found.  It
should not check that it is a chain of pairs beyond the found element.
The implementation must check the restrictions on @var{proc} to the
extent performed by applying it as described.  An implementation may
check whether @var{proc} is an appropriate argument before applying it.

(define d '((3 a) (1 b) (4 c)))

(assq (list 'a) '(((a)) ((b)) ((c))))           => #f
(assoc (list 'a) '(((a)) ((b)) ((c))))          => ((a))
(assq 5 '((2 3) (5 7) (11 13)))                 => unspecified
(assv 5 '((2 3) (5 7) (11 13)))                 => (5 7)
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {cons*} @vari{obj} @dots{} @varn{obj} @var{obj}
@deffnx Procedure {cons*} @var{obj}
If called with at least two arguments, @func{cons*} returns a freshly
allocated chain of pairs whose cars are @vari{obj}, @dots{}, @varn{obj},
and whose last cdr is @var{obj}.  If called with only one argument,
@func{cons*} returns that argument.

@example
(cons* 1 2 '(3 4 5))            => (1 2 3 4 5)
(cons* 1 2 3)                   => (1 2 . 3)
(cons* 1)                       => 1

@chapter Sorting


This chapter describes the @rsixlibrary{sorting} library for sorting
lists and vectors.


@deffn Procedure list-sort @var{proc list}
@deffnx Procedure vector-sort @var{proc vector}
@var{proc} should accept any two elements of @var{list} or @var{vector},
and should not have any side effects.  @var{proc} should return a true
value when its first argument is strictly less than its second, and
@false{} otherwise.

The @func{list-sort} and @func{vector-sort} procedures perform a stable
sort of @var{list} or @var{vector} in ascending order according to
@var{proc}, without changing @var{list} or @var{vector} in any way.  The
@func{list-sort} procedure returns a list, and @func{vector-sort}
returns a vector.

The results may be @func{eq?} to the argument when the argument is
already sorted, and the result of @func{list-sort} may share structure
with a tail of the original list.

The sorting algorithm performs @emph{O(n log n)} calls to @var{proc}
where @emph{n} is the length of @var{list} or @var{vector}, and all
arguments passed to @var{proc} are elements of the list or vector being
sorted, but the pairing of arguments and the sequencing of calls to
@var{proc} are not specified.  If multiple returns occur from
@func{list-sort} or @func{vector-sort}, the return values returned by
earlier returns are not mutated.

@example
(list-sort < '(3 5 2 1))                => (1 2 3 5)
(vector-sort < '#(3 5 2 1))             => #(1 2 3 5)
@end example

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
the restrictions on @var{proc} to the extent performed by applying it as
described.  An implementation may check whether @var{proc} is an
appropriate argument before applying it.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure vector-sort! @var{proc} @var{vector}
@var{proc} should accept any two elements of the vector, and should not
have any side effects.  @var{proc} should return a true value when its
first argument is strictly less than its second, and @false{}
otherwise.

The @func{vector-sort!} procedure destructively sorts @var{vector} in
ascending order according to @var{proc}.  The sorting algorithm performs
@emph{O(n^2)} calls to @var{proc} where @emph{n} is the length of
@var{vector}, and all arguments passed to @var{proc} are elements of the
vector being sorted, but the pairing of arguments and the sequencing of
calls to @var{proc} are not specified.  The sorting algorithm may be
unstable.  The procedure returns unspecified values.

@example
(define v (vector 3 5 2 1))
(vector-sort! < v)              => unspecified
v                               => #(1 2 3 5)
@end example

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
the restrictions on @var{proc} to the extent performed by applying it as
described.  An implementation may check whether @var{proc} is an
appropriate argument before applying it.

@node stdlib control
@chapter Control structures


This chapter describes the @rsixlibrary{control} library, which provides
useful control structures.


@deffn Syntax when @meta{test} @hyperi{expression} @hyperii{expression} @dots{}
@deffnx Syntax unless @meta{test} @hyperi{expression} @hyperii{expression} @dots{}
@meta{test} must be an expression.

A @func{when} expression is evaluated by evaluating the @meta{test}
expression.  If @meta{test} evaluates to a true value, the remaining
@hyper{expression}s are evaluated in order, and the results of the last
@hyper{expression} are returned as the results of the entire @func{when}
expression.  Otherwise, the @func{when} expression returns unspecified
values.

An @func{unless} expression is evaluated by evaluating the @meta{test}
expression.  If @meta{test} evaluates to @false{}, the remaining
@hyper{expression}s are evaluated in order, and the results of the last
@hyper{expression} are returned as the results of the entire
@func{unless} expression.  Otherwise, the @func{unless} expression
returns unspecified values.

The final @hyper{expression} is in tail context if the @func{when} or
@func{unless} form is itself in tail context.

@example
(when (> 3 2) 'greater)         => greater
(when (< 3 2) 'greater)         => unspecified
(unless (> 3 2) 'less)          => unspecified
(unless (< 3 2) 'less)          => less
@end example

The @func{when} and @func{unless} expressions are derived forms.  They
could be defined by the following macros:

@example
(define-syntax @code{when}
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((when test result1 result2 ...)
     (if test
         (begin result1 result2 ...)))))

(define-syntax @code{unless}
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((unless test result1 result2 ...)
     (if (not test)
         (begin result1 result2 ...)))))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax do ((@hyperi{variable} @hyperi{init} @hyperi{step}) @dots{}) (@meta{test} @hyper{expression} @dots{}) @meta{command} @dots{}
The @meta{init}s, @hyper{step}s, @hyper{test}s, and @hyper{command}s
must be expressions.  The @meta{variable}s must be pairwise distinct
variables.

The @func{do} expression is an iteration construct.  It specifies a set
of variables to be bound, how they are to be initialized at the start,
and how they are to be updated on each iteration.

A @func{do} expression is evaluated as follows: The @meta{init}
expressions are evaluated (in some unspecified order), the
@meta{variable}s are bound to fresh locations, the results of the
@meta{init} expressions are stored in the bindings of the
@meta{variable}s, and then the iteration phase begins.

Each iteration begins by evaluating @meta{test}; if the result is
@false{}, then the @meta{command}s are evaluated in order for effect,
the @meta{step} expressions are evaluated in some unspecified order, the
@meta{variable}s are bound to fresh locations holding the results, and
the next iteration begins.

If @meta{test} evaluates to a true value, the @meta{expression}s are
evaluated from left to right and the values of the last
@meta{expression} are returned.  If no @hyper{expression}s are present,
then the @code{do} expression returns unspecified values.

The region consists of the entire @func{do} expression except for the
@meta{init}s.

A @meta{step} may be omitted, in which case the effect is the same as if
@code{(@meta{variable} @hyper{init} @hyper{variable})} had been written
instead of @code{(@meta{variable} @hyper{init})}.

If a @code{do} expression appears in a tail context, the
@meta{expression}s are a @hyper{tail sequence} in the sense of report
section @ref{baselib tail call, Tail calls and tail contexts}, i.e.,
the last @meta{expression} is also in a tail context.

@example
(do ((vec (make-vector 5))
     (i 0 (+ i 1)))
    ((= i 5) vec)
  (vector-set! vec i i))                => #(0 1 2 3 4)

(let ((x '(1 3 5 7 9)))
  (do ((x x (cdr x))
       (sum 0 (+ sum (car x))))
      ((null? x) sum)))                 => 25
@end example

The following definition of @func{do} uses a trick to expand the
variable clauses.

@example
(define-syntax do
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((do ((var init step ...) ...)
         (test expr ...)
         command ...)
     (letrec
       ((loop
         (lambda (var ...)
           (if test
               (begin
                 #f ; avoid empty begin
                 expr ...)
               (begin
                 command
                 ...
                 (loop (do "step" var step ...)
                       ...))))))
       (loop init ...)))
    ((do "step" x)
     x)
    ((do "step" x y)
     y)))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax case-lambda @meta{case-lambda clause} @dots{}
Each @meta{case-lambda clause} must be of the form:

@example
(@meta{formals} @hyper{body})
@end example

@meta{formals} must be as in a @func{lambda} form (@ref{baselib
expressions procedures,Procedures}), and @meta{body} is as described in
report section @ref{baselib bodies,Bodies}.

A @func{case-lambda} expression evaluates to a procedure.  This
procedure, when applied, tries to match its arguments to the
@meta{case-lambda clause}s in order.  The arguments match a clause if
one of the following conditions is fulfilled:

@itemize
@item
@meta{formals} has the form @code{(@hyper{variable} @dots{})} and the
number of arguments is the same as the number of formal parameters in
@meta{formals}.

@item
@meta{formals} has the form:

@example
(@hyperi{variable} @dots{} @hypern{variable} . @meta{variable_(n+1)})
@end example

@noindent
and the number of arguments is at least @emph{n}.

@item
@meta{formals} has the form @code{@hyper{variable}}.
@end itemize

For the first clause matched by the arguments, the variables of the
@meta{formals} are bound to fresh locations containing the argument
values in the same arrangement as with @func{lambda}.

The last expression of a @meta{body} in a @func{case-lambda} expression
is in tail context.

If the arguments match none of the clauses, an exception with condition
type @code{&assertion} is raised.

@example
(define foo
  (case-lambda
   (() 'zero)
   ((x) (list 'one x))
   ((x y) (list 'two x y))
   ((a b c d . e) (list 'four a b c d e))
   (rest (list 'rest rest))))

(foo)                                   => zero
(foo 1)                                 => (one 1)
(foo 1 2)                               => (two 1 2)
(foo 1 2 3)                             => (rest (1 2 3))
(foo 1 2 3 4)                           => (four 1 2 3 4 ())
@end example

The @func{case-lambda} keyword can be defined in terms of @func{lambda}
by the following macros:

@example
(define-syntax case-lambda
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((_ (fmls b1 b2 ...))
     (lambda fmls b1 b2 ...))
    ((_ (fmls b1 b2 ...) ...)
     (lambda args
       (let ((n (length args)))
         (case-lambda-help args n
           (fmls b1 b2 ...) ...))))))

(define-syntax case-lambda-help
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((_ args n)
     (assertion-violation #f
       "unexpected number of arguments"))
    ((_ args n ((x ...) b1 b2 ...) more ...)
     (if (= n (length '(x ...)))
         (apply (lambda (x ...) b1 b2 ...) args)
         (case-lambda-help args n more ...)))
    ((_ args n ((x1 x2 ... . r) b1 b2 ...) more ...)
     (if (>= n (length '(x1 x2 ...)))
         (apply (lambda (x1 x2 ... . r) b1 b2 ...)
                   args)
         (case-lambda-help args n more ...)))
    ((_ args n (r b1 b2 ...) more ...)
     (apply (lambda r b1 b2 ...) args))))
@end example

@c page
@node stdlib records intro
@section Introduction


A record is a compound data structure with a fixed number of components,
called @emph{fields}.  Each record has an associated type specified by a
@emph{record-type descriptor}, which is an object that specifies the
fields of the record and various other properties that all records of
that type share.  Record objects are created by a @emph{record
constructor}, a procedure that creates a fresh record object and
initializes its fields to values.  Records of different types can be
distinguished from each other and from other types of objects by
@emph{record predicates}.  A record predicate returns @true{} when
passed a record of the type specified by the record--type descriptor and
@false{} otherwise.  An @emph{accessor} extracts from a record the
component associated with a field, and a @emph{mutator} changes the
component to a different value.

Record types can be extended via single inheritance, allowing record
types to model hierarchies that occur in applications like algebraic
data types as well as single--inheritance class systems.  If a record
type @var{t} extends another record type @var{p}, each record of type
@var{t} is also a record of type @var{p}, and the predicate, accessors,
and mutators applicable to a record of type @var{p} are also applicable
to a record of type @var{t}.  The extension relationship is transitive
in the sense that a type extends its parent's parent, if any, and so on.
A record type that does not extend another record type is called a
@emph{base record type}.

A record type can be @emph{sealed} to prevent it from being extended.
Moreover, a record type can be @emph{nongenerative}, i.e., it is
globally identified by a ``uid'', and new, compatible definitions of a
nongenerative record type with the same uid as a previous always yield
the same record type.

The record mechanism spans three libraries:

@table @rsixlibrary
@item records syntactic
library, a syntactic layer for defining a record type and associated
constructor, predicate, accessor, and mutators,

@item records procedural
library, a procedural layer for creating and manipulating record types
and creating constructors, predicates, accessors, and mutators;

@item records inspection
library, a set of inspection procedures.
@end table

The inspection procedures allow programs to obtain from a record
instance a descriptor for the type and from there obtain access to the
fields of the record instance. This facility allows the creation of
portable printers and inspectors.  A program may prevent access to a
record's type (and thereby protect the information stored in the record
from the inspection mechanism) by declaring the type opaque.  Thus,
opacity as presented here can be used to enforce abstraction barriers.

Any of the standard types mentioned in this report may or may not be
implemented as an opaque record type.  Thus, it may be possible to use
inspection on objects of the standard types.

The procedural layer is particularly useful for writing interpreters
that construct host--compatible record types.  It may also serve as a
target for expansion of the syntactic layers.  The record operations
provided through the procedural layer may, however, be less efficient
than the operations provided through the syntactic layer, which is
designed to allow expand--time determination of record--instance sizes
and field offsets.  Therefore, alternative implementations of syntactic
record--type definition should, when possible, expand into the syntactic
layer rather than the procedural layer.

The syntactic layer is used more commonly and therefore described first.
This chapter uses the @var{rtd} and @var{constructor-descriptor}
parameter names for arguments that must be record-type descriptors and
constructor descriptors, respectively.


@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@c page
@node stdlib records mutability
@section Mutability and equivalence of records


The fields of a record type are designated @emph{mutable} or
@emph{immutable}.  Correspondingly, a record type with no mutable field
is called @emph{immutable}, and all records of that type are immutable
objects.  All other record types are @emph{mutable}, and so are their
records.

Each call to a record constructor returns a new record with a fresh
location (see report section @ref{lang basic storage model,Storage
model}).  Consequently, for two records @vari{obj} and @varii{obj}, the
return value of @code{(eqv? @vari{obj} @varii{obj})}, as well as the
return value of @code{(eq? @vari{obj} @varii{obj})}, adheres to the
following criteria (see report section @ref{baselib
predicates,Equivalence predicates}):

@itemize
@item
If @vari{obj} and @varii{obj} have different record types (i.e., their
record--type descriptors are not @func{eqv?}), @func{eqv?}  returns
@false{}.

@item
If @vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are both records of the same record type,
and are the results of two separate calls to record constructors, then
@func{eqv?} returns @false{}.
@item
If @vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are both the result of a single call to a
record constructor, then @func{eqv?} returns @true{}.

@item
If @vari{obj} and @varii{obj} are both records of the same record type,
where applying an accessor to both yields results for which @func{eqv?}
returns @false{}, then @func{eqv?} returns @false{}.
@end itemize


@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@c page
@node stdlib records syntactic layer
@section Syntactic layer


The syntactic layer is provided by the @rsixlibrary{records syntactic}
library.  Some details of the specification are explained in terms of
the specification of the procedural layer below.

The record--type--defining form @func{define-record-type} is a
definition and can appear anywhere any other @meta{definition} can
appear.


@deffn Syntax define-record-type @meta{name spec} @arbno{@hyper{record clause}}
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} fields
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} mutable
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} immutable
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} parent
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} protocol
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} sealed
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} opaque
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} nongenerative
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} parent-rtd
A @func{define-record-type} form defines a record type along with
associated constructor descriptor and constructor, predicate, field
accessors, and field mutators.  The @func{define-record-type} form
expands into a set of definitions in the environment where
@func{define-record-type} appears; hence, it is possible to refer to the
bindings (except for that of the record type itself) recursively.

The @meta{name spec} specifies the names of the record type,
constructor, and predicate. It must take one of the following forms:

@example
(@meta{record name} @hyper{constructor name} @hyper{predicate name})
@meta{record name}
@end example

@meta{record name}, @hyper{constructor name}, and @hyper{predicate name}
must all be identifiers.

@meta{record name}, taken as a symbol, becomes the name of the record
type.  (See the description of @func{make-record-type-descriptor}
below.)  Additionally, it is bound by this definition to an expand--time
or run--time representation of the record type and can be used as parent
name in syntactic record--type definitions that extend this
definition. It can also be used as a handle to gain access to the
underlying record--type descriptor and constructor descriptor (see
@func{record-type-descriptor} and @func{record-constructor-descriptor}
below).

@meta{constructor name} is defined by this definition to be a
constructor for the defined record type, with a protocol specified by
the @code{protocol} clause, or, in its absence, using a default
protocol.  For details, see the description of the @code{protocol}
clause below.

@meta{predicate name} is defined by this definition to a predicate for
the defined record type.

The second form of @meta{name spec} is an abbreviation for the first
form, where the name of the constructor is generated by prefixing the
record name with @code{make-}, and the predicate name is generated by
adding a question mark (@code{?}) to the end of the record name. For
example, if the record name is @code{frob}, the name of the constructor
is @func{make-frob}, and the predicate name is @func{frob?}.

Each @meta{record clause} must take one of the following forms; it is a
syntax violation if multiple @meta{record clause}s of the same kind
appear in a @func{define-record-type} form.
@end deffn


@deffn {Auxiliary Syntax} fields @arbno{@meta{field spec}}
Each @meta{field spec} has one of the following forms

@example
(immutable @meta{field name} @hyper{accessor name})
(mutable @meta{field name}
         @meta{accessor name} @hyper{mutator name})
(immutable @meta{field name})
(mutable @meta{field name})
@meta{field name}
@end example

@meta{field name}, @hyper{accessor name}, and @hyper{mutator name} must
all be identifiers.  The first form declares an immutable field called
@meta{field name}, with the corresponding accessor named @meta{accessor
name}.  The second form declares a mutable field called @meta{field
name}, with the corresponding accessor named @meta{accessor name}, and
with the corresponding mutator named @meta{mutator name}.

If @meta{field spec} takes the third or fourth form, the accessor name
is generated by appending the record name and field name with a hyphen
separator, and the mutator name (for a mutable field) is generated by
adding a @code{-set!} suffix to the accessor name.  For example, if the
record name is @code{frob} and the field name is @code{widget}, the
accessor name is @func{frob-widget} and the mutator name is
@func{frob-widget-set!}.

If @meta{field spec} is just a @hyper{field name} form, it is an
abbreviation for @code{(immutable @meta{field name})}.

The @meta{field name}s become, as symbols, the names of the fields in
the record--type descriptor being created, in the same order.

The @code{fields} clause may be absent; this is equivalent to an empty
@code{fields} clause.
@end deffn


@deffn {Auxiliary Syntax} parent @meta{parent name}
Specifies that the record type is to have parent type @hyper{parent
name}, where @meta{parent name} is the @hyper{record name} of a record
type previously defined using @func{define-record-type}.  The
record--type definition associated with @meta{parent name} must not be
sealed.  If no @code{parent} clause and no @code{parent-rtd} (see below)
clause is present, the record type is a base type.
@end deffn


@deffn {Auxiliary Syntax} protocol @meta{expression}
@meta{expression} is evaluated in the same environment as the
@func{define-record-type} form, and must evaluate to a protocol
appropriate for the record type being defined.

The protocol is used to create a record--constructor descriptor as
described below.  If no @code{protocol} clause is specified, a
constructor descriptor is still created using a default protocol.  The
clause can be absent only if the record type being defined has no parent
type, or if the parent definition does not specify a protocol.
@end deffn


@deffn {Auxiliary Syntax} sealed #t
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} sealed #f
If this option is specified with operand @true{}, the defined record
type is sealed, i.e., no extensions of the record type can be created.
If this option is specified with operand @false{}, or is absent, the
defined record type is not sealed.
@end deffn


@deffn {Auxiliary Syntax} opaque #t
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} opaque #f
If this option is specified with operand @true{}, or if an opaque parent
record type is specified, the defined record type is opaque.  Otherwise,
the defined record type is not opaque.  See the specification of
@code{record-rtd} below for details.
@end deffn


@deffn {Auxiliary Syntax} nongenerative @meta{uid}
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} nongenerative
This specifies that the record type is nongenerative with uid
@meta{uid}, which must be an @hyper{identifier}.  If @meta{uid} is
absent, a unique uid is generated at macro--expansion time.  If two
record--type definitions specify the same @var{uid}, then the
record--type definitions should be equivalent, i.e., the implied
arguments to @func{make-record-type-descriptor} must be equivalent as
described under @func{make-record-type-descriptor}.

If this condition is not met, it is either considered a syntax violation
or an exception with condition type @code{&assertion} is raised.  If the
condition is met, a single record type is generated for both
definitions.

In the absence of a @code{nongenerative} clause, a new record type is
generated every time a @func{define-record-type} form is evaluated:

@example
(let ((f (lambda (x)
           (define-record-type r ...)
           (if x r? (make-r ...)))))
  ((f #t) (f #f)))
=> #f
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn {Auxiliary Syntax} parent-rtd @meta{parent rtd} @hyper{parent cd}
Specifies that the record type is to have its parent type specified by
@meta{parent rtd}, which should be an expression evaluating to a
record--type descriptor, and @meta{parent cd}, which should be an
expression evaluating to a constructor descriptor (see below).  Either
@meta{parent rtd} or @meta{parent cd} can evaluate to @false{}.  The
record--type definition associated with the value of @meta{parent rtd}
must not be sealed.  Moreover, a record--type definition must not have
both a @code{parent} and a @code{parent-rtd} clause.
@end deffn


@quotation
@emph{Note:} The syntactic layer is designed to allow record--instance
sizes and field offsets to be determined at expand time, i.e., by a
macro definition of @func{define-record-type}, as long as the parent (if
any) is known.  Implementations that take advantage of this may generate
less efficient constructor, accessor, and mutator code when the
@code{parent-rtd} clause is used, since the type of the parent is
generally not known until run time.  The @code{parent} clause should
therefore be used instead when possible.
@end quotation

All bindings created by @func{define-record-type} (for the record type,
the constructor, the predicate, the accessors, and the mutators) must
have names that are pairwise distinct.

The constructor created by a @func{define-record-type} form is a
procedure as follows:

@itemize
@item
If there is no @code{parent} clause and no @code{protocol} clause, the
constructor accepts as many arguments as there are fields, in the same
order as they appear in the @code{fields} clause, and returns a record
object with the fields initialized to the corresponding arguments.

@item
If there is no @code{parent} or @code{parent-rtd} clause and a
@code{protocol} clause, the protocol expression must evaluate to a
procedure that accepts a single argument.  The protocol procedure is
called once during the evaluation of the @func{define-record-type} form
with a procedure @var{p} as its argument.  It should return a procedure,
which will become the constructor bound to @meta{constructor name}.  The
procedure @var{p} accepts as many arguments as there are fields, in the
same order as they appear in the @code{fields} clause, and returns a
record object with the fields initialized to the corresponding
arguments.

The constructor returned by the protocol procedure can accept an
arbitrary number of arguments, and should call @var{p} once to construct
a record object, and return that record object.

For example, the following protocol expression for a record--type
definition with three fields creates a constructor that accepts values
for all fields, and initialized them in the reverse order of the
arguments:

@example
(lambda (p)
  (lambda (v1 v2 v3)
    (p v3 v2 v1)))
@end example

@item
If there is both a @code{parent} clause and a @code{protocol} clause,
then the protocol procedure is called once with a procedure @var{n} as
its argument.  As in the previous case, the protocol procedure should
return a procedure, which will become the constructor bound to
@meta{constructor name}.  However, @var{n} is different from @var{p} in
the previous case: It accepts arguments corresponding to the arguments
of the constructor of the parent type.  It then returns a procedure
@var{p} that accepts as many arguments as there are (additional) fields
in this type, in the same order as in the @code{fields} clause, and
returns a record object with the fields of the parent record types
initialized according to their constructors and the arguments to
@var{n}, and the fields of this record type initialized to its arguments
of @var{p}.

The constructor returned by the protocol procedure can accept an
arbitrary number of arguments, and should call @var{n} once to construct
the procedure @var{p}, and call @var{p} once to create the record
object, and finally return that record object.

For example, the following protocol expression assumes that the
constructor of the parent type takes three arguments:

@example
(lambda (n)
  (lambda (v1 v2 v3 x1 x2 x3 x4)
    (let ((p (n v1 v2 v3)))
      (p x1 x2 x3 x4))))
@end example

The resulting constructor accepts seven arguments, and initializes the
fields of the parent types according to the constructor of the parent
type, with @var{v1}, @var{v2}, and @var{v3} as arguments.  It also
initializes the fields of this record type to the values of @var{x1},
@dots{}, @var{x4}.

@item
If there is a @code{parent} clause, but no @code{protocol} clause, then
the parent type must not have a @code{protocol} clause itself.  The
constructor bound to @meta{constructor name} is a procedure that accepts
arguments corresponding to the parent types' constructor first, and then
one argument for each field in the same order as in the @code{fields}
clause.  The constructor returns a record object with the fields
initialized to the corresponding arguments.

@item
If there is a @code{parent-rtd} clause, then the constructor is as with
a @code{parent} clause, except that the constructor of the parent type
is determined by the constructor descriptor of the @code{parent-rtd}
clause.
@end itemize

A protocol may perform other actions consistent with the requirements
described above, including mutation of the new record or other side
effects, before returning the record.

Any definition that takes advantage of implicit naming for the
constructor, predicate, accessor, and mutator names can be rewritten
trivially to a definition that specifies all names explicitly. For
example, the implicit--naming record definition:

@example
(define-record-type frob
  (fields (mutable widget))
  (protocol
    (lambda (p)
      (lambda (n) (p (make-widget n))))))
@end example

@noindent
is equivalent to the following explicit--naming record definition.

@example
(define-record-type (frob make-frob frob?)
  (fields (mutable widget
                   frob-widget
                   frob-widget-set!))
  (protocol
    (lambda (p)
      (lambda (n) (p (make-widget n))))))
@end example

Also, the implicit--naming record definition:

@example
(define-record-type point (fields x y))
@end example

@noindent
is equivalent to the following explicit--naming record definition:

@example
(define-record-type (point make-point point?)
  (fields
    (immutable x point-x)
    (immutable y point-y)))
@end example

With implicit naming, it is still possible to specify some of the names
explicitly; for example, the following overrides the choice of accessor
and mutator names for the widget field.

@example
(define-record-type frob
  (fields (mutable widget getwid setwid!))
  (protocol
    (lambda (p)
      (lambda (n) (p (make-widget n))))))
@end example


@deffn Syntax record-type-descriptor @meta{record name}
Evaluates to the record--type descriptor (see below) associated with the
type specified by @meta{record name}.

@emph{Note:} The @func{record-type-descriptor} procedure works on both
opaque and non--opaque record types.

@node stdlib records procedural layer
@section Procedural layer


The procedural layer is provided by the @rsixlibrary{records procedural}
library.


@deffn Procedure make-record-type-descriptor @var{name} @var{parent} @var{uid} @var{sealed?} @var{opaque?} @var{fields}
Return a @emph{record-type descriptor}, or @emph{rtd}, representing a
record type distinct from all built--in types and other record types.

The @var{name} argument must be a symbol.  It names the record type, and
is intended purely for informational purposes and may be used for
printing by the underlying Scheme system.

The @var{parent} argument must be either @false{} or an rtd. If it is an
rtd, the returned record type, @var{t}, extends the record type @var{p}
represented by @var{parent}.  An exception with condition type
@code{&assertion} is raised if @var{parent} is sealed (see below).

The @var{uid} argument must be either @false{} or a symbol.  If
@var{uid} is a symbol, the record--creation operation is
@emph{nongenerative} i.e., a new record type is created only if no
previous call to @func{make-record-type-descriptor} was made with the
@var{uid}.  If @var{uid} is @false{}, the record--creation operation is
@emph{generative}, i.e., a new record type is created even if a previous
call to @func{make-record-type-descriptor} was made with the same
arguments.

If @func{make-record-type-descriptor} is called twice with the same
@var{uid} symbol, the parent arguments in the two calls must be
@func{eqv?}, the @var{fields} arguments @func{equal?}, the @var{sealed?}
arguments boolean--equivalent (both @false{} or both true), and the
@var{opaque?} arguments boolean--equivalent.  If these conditions are
not met, an exception with condition type @code{&assertion} is raised
when the second call occurs.  If they are met, the second call returns,
without creating a new record type, the same record--type descriptor (in
the sense of @func{eqv?}) as the first call.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Users are encouraged to use symbol names constructed using
the @acronym{UUID} namespace (for example, using the record--type name
as a prefix) for the uid argument.
@end quotation

The @var{sealed?} flag must be a boolean.  If true, the returned record
type is sealed, i.e., it cannot be extended.

The @var{opaque?} flag must be a boolean.  If true, the record type is
opaque.  If passed an instance of the record type, @func{record?}
returns @false{}.  Moreover, if @code{record-rtd} (see ``Inspection''
below) is called with an instance of the record type, an exception with
condition type @code{&assertion} is raised.  The record type is also
opaque if an opaque parent is supplied.  If @var{opaque?} is @false{}
and an opaque parent is not supplied, the record is not opaque.

The @var{fields} argument must be a vector of field specifiers. Each
field specifier must be a list of the form @code{(mutable @var{name})}
or a list of the form @code{(immutable @var{name})}.  Each name must be
a symbol and names the corresponding field of the record type; the names
need not be distinct.  A field identified as mutable may be modified,
whereas, when a program attempts to obtain a mutator for a field
identified as immutable, an exception with condition type
@code{&assertion} is raised.  Where field order is relevant, e.g., for
record construction and field access, the fields are considered to be
ordered as specified, although no particular order is required for the
actual representation of a record instance.

The specified fields are added to the parent fields, if any, to
determine the complete set of fields of the returned record type.  If
@var{fields} is modified after @func{make-record-type-descriptor} has
been called, the effect on the returned rtd is unspecified.

A generative record--type descriptor created by a call to
@func{make-record-type-descriptor} is not @func{eqv?} to any
record--type descriptor (generative or nongenerative) created by another
call to @func{make-record-type-descriptor}.  A generative record--type
descriptor is @func{eqv?}  only to itself, i.e., @code{(eqv? @vari{rtd}
@varii{rtd})} if, and only if, @code{(eq? @vari{rtd} @varii{rtd})}.
Also, two nongenerative record--type descriptors are @func{eqv?} if, and
only if, they were created by calls to
@func{make-record-type-descriptor} with the same uid arguments.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure record-type-descriptor? @var{obj}
Return @true{} if the argument is a record--type descriptor, @false{}
otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure make-record-constructor-descriptor @var{rtd} @var{parent-constructor-descriptor} @var{protocol}
Return a @emph{record-constructor descriptor} (or @emph{constructor
descriptor} for short) that specifies a @emph{record constructor} (or
@emph{constructor} for short), that can be used to construct record
values of the type specified by @var{rtd}, and which can be obtained via
@func{record-constructor}.  A constructor descriptor can also be used to
create other constructor descriptors for subtypes of its own record
type.  @var{rtd} must be a record--type descriptor.  @var{protocol} must
be a procedure or @false{}.  If it is @false{}, a default @var{protocol}
procedure is supplied.

If @var{protocol} is a procedure, it is handled analogously to the
protocol expression in a @func{define-record-type} form.

If @var{rtd} is a base record type @var{parent-constructor-descriptor}
must be @false{}.  In this case, @var{protocol} is called by
@func{record-constructor} with a single argument @var{p}.  @var{p} is a
procedure that expects one argument for every field of @var{rtd} and
returns a record with the fields of @var{rtd} initialized to these
arguments.  The procedure returned by @var{protocol} should call @var{p}
once with the number of arguments @var{p} expects and return the
resulting record as shown in the simple example below:

@example
(lambda (p)
  (lambda (v1 v2 v3)
    (p v1 v2 v3)))
@end example

Here, the call to @code{p} returns a record whose fields are initialized
with the values of @code{v1}, @code{v2}, and @code{v3}.  The expression
above is equivalent to @code{(lambda (p) p)}.  Note that the procedure
returned by @var{protocol} is otherwise unconstrained; specifically, it
can take any number of arguments.

If @var{rtd} is an extension of another record type @var{parent-rtd} and
@var{protocol} is a procedure, @var{parent-constructor-descriptor} must
be a constructor descriptor of @var{parent-rtd} or @false{}.  If
@var{parent-constructor-descriptor} is a constructor descriptor,
@var{protocol} it is called by @code{record-constructor} with a single
argument @var{n}, which is a procedure that accepts the same number of
arguments as the constructor of @var{parent-constructor-descriptor} and
returns a procedure @var{p} that, when called, constructs the record
itself.  The @var{p} procedure expects one argument for every field of
@var{rtd} (not including parent fields) and returns a record with the
fields of @var{rtd} initialized to these arguments, and the fields of
@var{parent-rtd} and its parents initialized as specified by
@var{parent-constructor-descriptor}.

The procedure returned by @var{protocol} should call @var{n} once with
the number of arguments @var{n} expects, call the procedure @var{p} it
returns once with the number of arguments @var{p} expects and return the
resulting record.  A simple @var{protocol} in this case might be written
as follows:

@example
(lambda (n)
  (lambda (v1 v2 v3 x1 x2 x3 x4)
    (let ((p (n v1 v2 v3)))
      (p x1 x2 x3 x4))))
@end example

This passes arguments @var{v1}, @var{v2}, @var{v3} to @var{n} for
@var{parent-constructor-descriptor} and calls @func{p} with @var{x1},
@dots{}, @var{x4} to initialize the fields of @var{rtd} itself.

Thus, the constructor descriptors for a record type form a sequence of
protocols parallel to the sequence of record--type parents.  Each
constructor descriptor in the chain determines the field values for the
associated record type.  Child record constructors need not know the
number or contents of parent fields, only the number of arguments
accepted by the parent constructor.

@var{protocol} may be @false{}, specifying a default constructor that
accepts one argument for each field of @var{rtd} (including the fields
of its parent type, if any).  Specifically, if @var{rtd} is a base type,
the default @var{protocol} procedure behaves as if it were @code{(lambda
(p) p)}.  If @var{rtd} is an extension of another type, then
@var{parent-constructor-descriptor} must be either @false{} or itself
specify a default constructor, and the default @var{protocol} procedure
behaves as if it were:

@example
(lambda (n)
  (lambda (@vari{v} @dots{} @varj{v} @vari{x} @dots{} @vark{x})
    (let ((p (n @vari{v} @dots{} @varj{v})))
      (p @vari{x} @dots{} @vark{x}))))
@end example

The resulting constructor accepts one argument for each of the record
type's complete set of fields (including those of the parent record
type, the parent's parent record type, etc.) and returns a record with
the fields initialized to those arguments, with the field values for the
parent coming before those of the extension in the argument list.  (In
the example, @emph{j} is the complete number of fields of the parent
type, and $k$ is the number of fields of @var{rtd} itself.)

If @var{rtd} is an extension of another record type and
@var{parent-constructor-descriptor} is @false{},
@var{parent-constructor-descriptor} is treated as if it were a
constructor descriptor for the parent rtd of @var{rtd} with a default
protocol.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} If @var{protocol} is a
procedure, the implementation must check the restrictions on it to the
extent performed by applying it as described when the constructor is
called.  An implementation may check whether @var{protocol} is an
appropriate argument before applying it.

@example
(define rtd1
  (make-record-type-descriptor
   'rtd1 #f #f #f #f
   '#((immutable x1) (immutable x2))))

(define rtd2
  (make-record-type-descriptor

   '#((immutable x3) (immutable x4))))

  (lambda (n)
    (lambda (a b c d e f)
      (let ((p (n a b c)))
        (p (+ d e) (+ e f))))))

(define protocol3
  (lambda (n)
    (lambda (a b c d e f g h i)
      (let ((p (n a b c d e f)))
        (p (+ g h) (+ h i))))))

@deffn Procedure record-constructor @var{constructor-descriptor}
Call the @var{protocol} of @var{constructor-descriptor} (as described
for @func{make-record-constructor-descriptor}) and returns the resulting
constructor @var{constructor} for records of the record type associated
with @var{constructor-descriptor}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure record-predicate @var{rtd}
Return a procedure that, given an object @var{obj}, returns @true{} if
@var{obj} is a record of the type represented by @var{rtd}, and @false{}
otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure record-accessor @var{rtd} @var{k}
@var{k} must be a valid field index of @var{rtd}.  The
@func{record-accessor} procedure returns a one--argument procedure whose
argument must be a record of the type represented by @var{rtd}.  This
procedure returns the value of the selected field of that record.

The field selected corresponds to the @var{k}th element (0--based) of
the @var{fields} argument to the invocation of
@func{make-record-type-descriptor} that created @var{rtd}.  Note that
@var{k} cannot be used to specify a field of any type @var{rtd} extends.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure record-mutator @var{rtd} @var{k}
@var{k} must be a valid field index of @var{rtd}.  The
@func{record-mutator} procedure returns a two--argument procedure whose
arguments must be a record record @var{r} of the type represented by
@var{rtd} and an object @var{obj}.  This procedure stores @var{obj}
within the field of @var{r} specified by @var{k}.  The @var{k} argument
is as in @func{record-accessor}.  If @var{k} specifies an immutable
field, an exception with condition type @code{&assertion} is raised.
The mutator returns unspecified values.

@section Inspection


The @rsixlibrary{records inspection} library provides procedures for
inspecting records and their record--type descriptors.  These procedures
are designed to allow the writing of portable printers and inspectors.

On the one hand, @func{record?} and @func{record-rtd} treat records of
opaque record types as if they were not records.  On the other hand, the
inspection procedures that operate on record--type descriptors
themselves are not affected by opacity.  In other words, opacity
controls whether a program can obtain an rtd from a record.  If the
program has access to the original rtd via
@func{make-record-type-descriptor} or @func{record-type-descriptor}, it
can still make use of the inspection procedures.


@deffn Procedure record? @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a record, and its record type is not
opaque, and return @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure record-rtd @var{record}
Return the rtd representing the type of @var{record} if the type is not
opaque.  The rtd of the most precise type is returned; that is, the type
@var{t} such that @var{record} is of type @var{t} but not of any type
that extends @var{t}.  If the type is opaque, an exception is raised
with condition type @code{&assertion}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure record-type-name @var{rtd}
Return the name of the record--type descriptor @var{rtd}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure record-type-parent @var{rtd}
Return the parent of the record--type descriptor @var{rtd}, or @false{}
if it has none.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure record-type-uid @var{rtd}
Return the uid of the record--type descriptor rtd, or @false{} if it has
none.  (An implementation may assign a generated uid to a record type
even if the type is generative, so the return of a uid does not
necessarily imply that the type is nongenerative.)
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure record-type-generative? @var{rtd}
Return @true{} if @var{rtd} is generative, and @false{} if not.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure record-type-sealed? @var{rtd}
Return @true{} if the record-type descriptor is sealed, and @false{} if
not.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure record-type-opaque? @var{rtd}
Return @true{} if the the record-type descriptor is opaque, and @false{}
if not.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure record-type-field-names @var{rtd}
Return a vector of symbols naming the fields of the type represented by
@var{rtd} (not including the fields of parent types) where the fields
are ordered as described under @func{make-record-type-descriptor}.  The
returned vector may be immutable.  If the returned vector is modified,
the effect on @var{rtd} is unspecified.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure record-field-mutable? @var{rtd} @var{k}
Returns @true{} if the field specified by @var{k} of the type
represented by @var{rtd} is mutable, and @false{} if not.  @var{k} is as
in @func{record-accessor}.

@chapter Exceptions and conditions


Scheme allows programs to deal with exceptional situations using two
cooperating facilities: The exception system for raising and handling
exceptional situations, and the condition system for describing these
situations.

The exception system allows the program, when it detects an exceptional
situation, to pass control to an exception handler, and to dynamically
establish such exception handlers.  Exception handlers are always
invoked with an object describing the exceptional situation.  Scheme's
condition system provides a standardized taxonomy of such descriptive
objects, as well as a facility for extending the taxonomy.

@node stdlib exceptions exceptions
@section Exceptions


This section describes Scheme's exception--handling and
exception--raising constructs provided by the @rsixlibrary{exceptions}
library.

Exception handlers are one--argument procedures that determine the
action the program takes when an exceptional situation is signalled.
The system implicitly maintains a current exception handler.

The program raises an exception by invoking the current exception
handler, passing it an object encapsulating information about the
exception.  Any procedure accepting one argument may serve as an
exception handler and any object may be used to represent an exception.

The system maintains the current exception handler as part of the
dynamic environment of the program; see report section @ref{lang basic
dynamic extent,Dynamic extent and dynamic environment}.

When a program begins its execution, the current exception handler is
expected to handle all @code{&serious} conditions by interrupting
execution, reporting that an exception has been raised, and displaying
information about the condition object that was provided.  The handler
may then exit, or may provide a choice of other options.  Moreover, the
exception handler is expected to return when passed any other
non--@code{&serious} condition.  Interpretation of these expectations
necessarily depends upon the nature of the system in which programs are
executed, but the intent is that users perceive the raising of an
exception as a controlled escape from the situation that raised the
exception, not as a crash.


@deffn Procedure with-exception-handler @var{handler} @var{thunk}
@var{handler} must be a procedure and should accept one argument.
@var{thunk} must be a procedure that accepts zero arguments.  The
@func{with-exception-handler} procedure returns the results of invoking
@var{thunk}.  @var{handler} is installed as the current exception
handler for the dynamic extent (as determined by @func{dynamic-wind}) of
the invocation of @var{thunk}.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
the restrictions on @var{handler} to the extent performed by applying it
as described when it is called as a result of a call to @func{raise} or
@func{raise-continuable}.  An implementation may check whether
@var{handler} is an appropriate argument before applying it.
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax guard (@meta{variable} @hyperi{cond clause} @hyperii{cond clause} @dots{}) @meta{body}
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} {=>}
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} else
Each @meta{cond clause} is as in the specification of @func{cond}.  (See
report section @ref{baselib expressions derived cond,Derived
conditionals}.)  @code{=>} and @code{else} are the same as in the
@rsixlibrary{base} library.

Evaluating a @func{guard} form evaluates @meta{body} with an exception
handler that binds the raised object to @meta{variable} and within the
scope of that binding evaluates the clauses as if they were the clauses
of a @func{cond} expression.  That implicit @func{cond} expression is
evaluated with the continuation and dynamic environment of the
@func{guard} expression.  If every @meta{cond clause}'s @hyper{test}
evaluates to @false{} and there is no @code{else} clause, then
@func{raise-continuable} is re--invoked on the raised object within the
dynamic environment of the original call to @func{raise} except that the
current exception handler is that of the @func{guard} expression.

The final expression in a @meta{cond} clause is in a tail context if the
@func{guard} expression itself is.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure raise @var{obj}
Raise a non--continuable exception by invoking the current exception
handler on @var{obj}.  The handler is called with a continuation whose
dynamic environment is that of the call to @func{raise}, except that the
current exception handler is the one that was in place when the handler
being called was installed.  When the handler returns, a
non--continuable exception with condition type @code{&non-continuable}
is raised in the same dynamic environment as the handler.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure raise-continuable @var{obj}
Raise a @emph{continuable exception} by invoking the current exception
handler on @var{obj}. The handler is called with a continuation that is
equivalent to the continuation of the call to @func{raise-continuable},
with these two exceptions:

@enumerate
@item
the current exception handler is the one that was in place when the
handler being called was installed, and

@item
if the handler being called returns, then it will again become the
current exception handler.
@end enumerate

If the handler returns, the values it returns become the values returned
by the call to @code{raise-continuable}.
@end deffn

         ((error? con)

@section Conditions


The section describes Scheme's @rsixlibrary{conditions} library for
creating and inspecting condition types and values.  A condition value
encapsulates information about an exceptional situation.  Scheme also
defines a number of basic condition types.

Scheme conditions provides two mechanisms to enable communication about
an exceptional situation: subtyping among condition types allows
handling code to determine the general nature of an exception even
though it does not anticipate its exact nature, and compound conditions
allow an exceptional situation to be described in multiple ways.

@node stdlib exceptions conditions objects
@subsection Condition objects


Conceptually, there are two different kinds of condition objects:
@emph{simple conditions} and @emph{compound conditions}.  An object that
is either a simple condition or a compound condition is simply a
@emph{condition}.  Compound conditions form a type disjoint from the
base types described in report section @ref{baselib types,Base types}.
A simple condition describes a single aspect of an exceptional
situation.  A compound condition represents multiple aspects of an
exceptional situation as a list of simple conditions, its
@emph{components}.  Most of the operations described in this section
treat a simple condition identically to a compound condition with itself
as its own sole component.  For a subtype @var{t} of @code{&condition},
a @emph{condition of type @var{t}} is either a record of type @var{t} or
a compound condition containing a component of type @var{t}.


@deffn {Condition Type} {&condition}
Simple conditions are records of subtypes of the @code{&condition}
record type.  The @code{&condition} type has no fields and is neither
sealed nor opaque.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure condition @vari{condition} @dots{}
The @func{condition} procedure returns a condition object with the
components of the @var{condition}s as its components, in the same order,
i.e., with the components of @vari{condition} appearing first in the
same order as in @vari{condition}, then with the components of
@varii{condition}, and so on.  The returned condition is compound if the
total number of components is zero or greater than one.  Otherwise, it
may be compound or simple.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure simple-conditions @var{condition}
The @func{simple-conditions} procedure returns a list of the components
of @var{condition}, in the same order as they appeared in the
construction of @var{condition}.  The returned list is immutable.  If
the returned list is modified, the effect on @var{condition} is
unspecified.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Because @func{condition} decomposes its arguments into
simple conditions, @func{simple-conditions} always returns a
``flattened'' list of simple conditions.
@end quotation
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {condition?} @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a (simple or compound) condition,
otherwise returns @false{}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure condition-predicate @var{rtd}
@var{rtd} must be a record--type descriptor of a subtype of
@code{&condition}.  The @func{condition-predicate} procedure returns a
procedure that takes one argument.  This procedure returns @true{} if
its argument is a condition of the condition type represented by
@var{rtd}, i.e., if it is either a simple condition of that record type
(or one of its subtypes) or a compound conditition with such a simple
condition as one of its components, and @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure condition-accessor @var{rtd} @var{proc}
@var{rtd} must be a record--type descriptor of a subtype of
@code{&condition}.  @var{proc} should accept one argument, a record of
the record type of @var{rtd}.  The @func{condition-accessor} procedure
returns a procedure that accepts a single argument, which must be a
condition of the type represented by @var{rtd}.  This procedure extracts
the first component of the condition of the type represented by
@var{rtd}, and returns the result of applying @var{proc} to that
component.

@end example


@deffn Syntax define-condition-type @meta{condition-type} @meta{supertype} @meta{constructor} @hyper{predicate} @hyperi{field-spec} @dots{}
@meta{condition-type}, @hyper{supertypes}, @meta{constructor}, and
@hyper{predicate} must all be identifiers.  Each @meta{field-spec} must
be of the form

@example
(@meta{field} @hyper{accessor})
@end example

@noindent
where both @meta{field} and @hyper{accessor} must be identifiers.

The @func{define-condition-type} form expands into a record--type
definition for a record type @meta{condition-type}.  The record type
will be non--opaque, non--sealed, and its fields will be immutable.  It
will have @meta{supertype} has its parent type.  The remaining
identifiers will be bound as follows:

@itemize
@item
@meta{constructor} is bound to a default constructor for the type: It
accepts one argument for each of the record type's complete set of
fields (including parent types, with the fields of the parent coming
before those of the extension in the arguments) and returns a condition
object initialized to those arguments.

@item
@meta{predicate} is bound to a predicate that identifies conditions of
type @meta{condition-type} or any of its subtypes.

@item
Each @meta{accessor} is bound to a procedure that extracts the
corresponding field from a condition of type @meta{condition-type}.

@node stdlib io port
@section Port input/output


The @rsixlibrary{io ports} library defines an I/O layer for
conventional, imperative buffered input and output.  A @emph{port}
represents a buffered access object for a data sink or source or both
simultaneously.  The library allows ports to be created from arbitrary
data sources and sinks.

The @rsixlibrary{io ports} library distinguishes between @emph{input
ports} and @emph{output ports}.  An input port is a source for data,
whereas an output port is a sink for data.  A port may be both an input
port and an output port; such a port typically provides simultaneous
read and write access to a file or other data.

The @rsixlibrary{io ports} library also distinguishes between
@emph{binary ports}, which are sources or sinks for uninterpreted bytes,
and @emph{textual ports}, which are sources or sinks for characters and
strings.

This section uses @var{input-port}, @var{output-port},
@var{binary-port}, @var{textual-port}, @var{binary-input-port},
@var{textual-input-port}, @var{binary-output-port},
@var{textual-output-port}, and @var{port} as names for arguments that
must be input ports (or combined input/output ports), output ports (or
combined input/output ports), binary ports, textual ports, binary input
ports, textual input ports, binary output ports, textual output ports,
or any kind of port, respectively.

@node stdlib io port file names
@subsection File names


Some of the procedures described in this chapter accept a file name as
an argument.  Valid values for such a file name include strings that
name a file using the native notation of filesystem paths on an
implementation's underlying operating system, and may include
implementation--dependent values as well.

A @var{filename} parameter name means that the corresponding argument
must be a file name.


@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@c page
@node stdlib io port file options
@subsection File options


When opening a file, the various procedures in this library accept a
@code{file-options} object that encapsulates flags to specify how the
file is to be opened.  A @code{file-options} object is an enum--set over
the symbols constituting valid file options.  A @var{file-options}
parameter name means that the corresponding argument must be a
file--options object.


@deffn Syntax file-options @meta{file-options symbol} @dots{}
Each @meta{file-options symbol} must be a symbol.  The
@code{file-options} syntax returns a file--options object that
encapsulates the specified options.

When supplied to an operation that opens a file for output, the
file--options object returned by @code{(file-options)} (without
arguments) specifies that the file is created if it does not exist and
an exception with condition type @code{&i/o-file-already-exists} is
raised if it does exist.  The following standard options can be included
to modify the default behavior.

@table @code
@item no-create
If the file does not already exist, it is not created; instead, an
exception with condition type @code{&i/o-file-does-not-exist} is raised.
If the file already exists, the exception with condition type
@code{&i/o-file-already-exists} is not raised and the file is truncated
to zero length.

@item no-fail
If the file already exists, the exception with condition type
@code{&i/o-file-already-exists} is not raised, even if @code{no-create}
is not included, and the file is truncated to zero length.

@item no-truncate
If the file already exists and the exception with condition type
@code{&i/o-file-already-exists} has been inhibited by inclusion of
@code{no-create} or @code{no-fail}, the file is not truncated, but the
port's current position is still set to the beginning of the file.
@end table

These options have no effect when a file is opened only for input.
Symbols other than those listed above may be used as @meta{file-options
symbol}s; they have implementation--specific meaning, if any.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Only the name of @meta{file-options symbol} is significant.
@end quotation
@end deffn


@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@c page
@node stdlib io port buffer modes
@subsection Buffer modes


Each port has an associated buffer mode.  For an output port, the buffer
mode defines when an output operation flushes the buffer associated with
the output port.  For an input port, the buffer mode defines how much
data will be read to satisfy read operations.  The possible buffer modes
are the symbols:

@table @code
@item none
for no buffering,

@item line
for flushing upon line endings and reading up to line endings, or other
implementation--dependent behavior,

@item block
for arbitrary buffering.
@end table

This section uses the parameter name @var{buffer-mode} for arguments
that must be buffer-mode symbols.

If two ports are connected to the same mutable source, both ports are
unbuffered, and reading a byte or character from that shared source via
one of the two ports would change the bytes or characters seen via the
other port, a lookahead operation on one port will render the peeked
byte or character inaccessible via the other port, while a subsequent
read operation on the peeked port will see the peeked byte or character
even though the port is otherwise unbuffered.

In other words, the semantics of buffering is defined in terms of side
effects on shared mutable sources, and a lookahead operation has the
same side effect on the shared source as a read operation.


@deffn Syntax buffer-mode @meta{buffer-mode symbol}
@meta{buffer-mode symbol} must be a symbol whose name is one of
@code{none}, @code{line}, and @code{block}.  The result is the
corresponding symbol, and specifies the associated buffer mode.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Only the name of @meta{buffer-mode symbol} is significant.
@end quotation
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {buffer-mode?} @var{obj}
Return @true{} if the argument is a valid buffer--mode symbol, and
returns @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn

@c page
@node stdlib io port transcoders
@subsection Transcoders


Several different Unicode encoding schemes describe standard ways to
encode characters and strings as byte sequences and to decode those
sequences.  Within this document, a @emph{codec} is an immutable Scheme
object that represents a Unicode or similar encoding scheme.

An @emph{end--of--line style} is a symbol that, if it is not
@code{none}, describes how a textual port transcodes representations of
line endings.

A @emph{transcoder} is an immutable Scheme object that combines a codec
with an end--of--line style and a method for handling decoding errors.
Each transcoder represents some specific bidirectional (but not
necessarily lossless), possibly stateful translation between byte
sequences and Unicode characters and strings.  Every transcoder can
operate in the input direction (bytes to characters) or in the output
direction (characters to bytes).  A @var{transcoder} parameter name
means that the corresponding argument must be a transcoder.

A @emph{binary port} is a port that supports binary I/O, does not have
an associated transcoder and does not support textual I/O.  A
@emph{textual port} is a port that supports textual I/O, and does not
support binary I/O.  A textual port may or may not have an associated
transcoder.


@deffn Procedure latin-1-codec
@deffnx Procedure utf-8-codec
@deffnx Procedure utf-16-codec
These are predefined codecs for the @iso{} 8859-1, @utf{}-8, and
@utf{}-16 encoding schemes.

A call to any of these procedures returns a value that is equal in the
sense of @func{eqv?} to the result of any other call to the same
procedure.
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax eol-style @meta{eol-style symbol}
@meta{eol-style symbol} should be a symbol whose name is one of
@code{lf}, @code{cr}, @code{crlf}, @code{nel}, @code{crnel}, @code{ls},
and @code{none}.

The form evaluates to the corresponding symbol.  If the name of
@meta{eol-style symbol} is not one of these symbols, the effect and
result are implementation--dependent; in particular, the result may be
an eol--style symbol acceptable as an @var{eol-style} argument to
@code{make-transcoder}.  Otherwise, an exception is raised.

All eol--style symbols except @code{none} describe a specific
line--ending encoding:

@example
lf              @meta{linefeed}
cr              @meta{carriage return}
crlf            @meta{carriage return} @meta{linefeed}
nel             @meta{next line}
crnel           @meta{carriage return} @meta{next line}
ls              @meta{line separator}
@end example

For a textual port with a transcoder, and whose transcoder has an
eol--style symbol @code{none}, no conversion occurs.  For a textual
input port, any eol--style symbol other than @code{none} means that all
of the above line-ending encodings are recognized and are translated
into a single linefeed.  For a textual output port, @code{none} and
@code{lf} are equivalent.  Linefeed characters are encoded according to
the specified eol-style symbol, and all other characters that
participate in possible line endings are encoded as is.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Only the name of @meta{eol-style symbol} is significant.
@end quotation
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure native--eol--style
Return the default end--of--line style of the underlying platform, e.g.,
@code{lf} on Unix and @code{crlf} on Windows.
@end deffn


@deffn {Condition Type} {i/o-decoding}
@deffnx Procedure {make-i/o-decoding-error} @var{port}
@deffnx Procedure {i/o-decoding-error?} @var{obj}
This condition type could be defined by:

@example
(define-condition-type &i/o-decoding &i/o-port
  make-i/o-decoding-error i/o-decoding-error?)
@end example

An exception with this type is raised when one of the operations for
textual input from a port encounters a sequence of bytes that cannot be
translated into a character or string by the input direction of the
port's transcoder.

When such an exception is raised, the port's position is past the
invalid encoding.
@end deffn


@deffn {Condition Type} {i/o-encoding}
@deffnx Procedure {make-i/o-encoding-error} @var{pobj} @var{cobj}

This condition type could be defined by:

@example
(define-condition-type &i/o-encoding &i/o-port
  make-i/o-encoding-error i/o-encoding-error?
  (char i/o-encoding-error-char))
@end example

An exception with this type is raised when one of the operations for
textual output to a port encounters a character that cannot be
translated into bytes by the output direction of the port's transcoder.
@var{cobj} is the character that could not be encoded.
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax error-handling-mode @meta{error-handling-mode symbol}
@meta{error-handling-mode symbol} should be a symbol whose name is one
of @code{ignore}, @code{raise}, and @code{replace}.

The form evaluates to the corresponding symbol.  If
@meta{error-handling-mode symbol} is not one of these identifiers,
effect and result are implementation--dependent: The result may be an
error--handling--mode symbol acceptable as a @var{handling-mode}
argument to @func{make-transcoder}.  If it is not acceptable as a
@var{handling-mode} argument to @func{make-transcoder}, an exception is
raised.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Only the name of @meta{error-handling-style symbol} is
significant.
@end quotation

The error--handling mode of a transcoder specifies the behavior of
textual I/O operations in the presence of encoding or decoding errors.

If a textual input operation encounters an invalid or incomplete
character encoding, and the error--handling mode is @code{ignore}, an
appropriate number of bytes of the invalid encoding are ignored and
decoding continues with the following bytes.  If the error--handling
mode is @code{replace}, the replacement character @code{U+FFFD} is
injected into the data stream, an appropriate number of bytes are
ignored, and decoding continues with the following bytes.  If the
error--handling mode is @code{raise}, an exception with condition type
@code{&i/o-decoding} is raised.

If a textual output operation encounters a character it cannot encode,
and the error--handling mode is @code{ignore}, the character is ignored
and encoding continues with the next character.  If the error--handling
mode is @code{replace}, a codec--specific replacement character is
emitted by the transcoder, and encoding continues with the next
character.  The replacement character is @code{U+FFFD} for transcoders
whose codec is one of the Unicode encodings, but is the @code{?}
character for the Latin--1 encoding.  If the error--handling mode is
@code{raise}, an exception with condition type @code{&i/o-encoding} is
raised.

@var{codec} must be a codec; @var{eol-style}, if present, an eol--style
symbol; and @var{handling-mode}, if present, an error--handling--mode
symbol.

@var{eol-style} may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the native

textual and has an associated transcoder, and returns @false{} if
@var{port} is binary or does not have an associated transcoder.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {textual-port?} @var{port}
@deffnx Procedure {binary-port?} @var{port}
The @func{textual-port?} procedure returns @true{} if @var{port} is
textual, and returns @false{} otherwise.

The @func{binary-port?}  procedure returns @true{} if @var{port} is
binary, and returns @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {transcoded-port} @var{binary-port} @var{transcoder}
The @func{transcoded-port} procedure returns a new textual port with the
specified @var{transcoder}.  Otherwise the new textual port's state is
largely the same as that of @var{binary-port}.

If @var{binary-port} is an input port, the new textual port will be an
input port and will transcode the bytes that have not yet been read from
@var{binary-port}.  If @var{binary-port} is an output port, the new
textual port will be an output port and will transcode output characters
into bytes that are written to the byte sink represented by
@var{binary-port}.

As a side effect, however, @func{transcoded-port} closes
@var{binary-port} in a special way that allows the new textual port to
continue to use the byte source or sink represented by
@var{binary-port}, even though @var{binary-port} itself is closed and
cannot be used by the input and output operations described in this
chapter.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {port-has-port-position?} @var{port}
@deffnx Procedure port-position @var{port}
The @func{port-has-port-position?} procedure returns @true{} if the port
supports the @func{port-position} operation, and @false{} otherwise.

For a binary port, the @func{port-position} procedure returns the index
of the position at which the next byte would be read from or written to
the port as an exact non--negative integer object.  For a textual port,
@func{port-position} returns a value of some implementation--dependent
type representing the port's position; this value may be useful only as
the @var{pos} argument to @func{set-port-position!}, if the latter is
supported on the port (see below).

If the port does not support the operation, @func{port-position} raises
an exception with condition type @code{&assertion}.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} For a textual port, the port position may or may not be an
integer object.  If it is an integer object, the integer object does not
necessarily correspond to a byte or character position.
@end quotation
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {port-has-set-port-position!?} @var{port}
@deffnx Procedure {set-port-position!} @var{port} @var{pos}
If @var{port} is a binary port, @var{pos} should be a non--negative
exact integer object.  If @var{port} is a textual port, @var{pos} should
be the return value of a call to @func{port-position} on @var{port}.

The @func{port-has-set-port-position!?} procedure returns @true{} if the
port supports the @func{set-port-position!} operation, and @false{}
otherwise.

The @func{set-port-position!} procedure raises an exception with
condition type @code{&assertion} if the port does not support the
operation, and an exception with condition type
@code{&i/o-invalid-position} if @var{pos} is not in the range of valid
positions of @var{port}.  Otherwise, it sets the current position of the
port to @var{pos}.  If @var{port} is an output port,
@func{set-port-position!} first flushes @var{port}.

If @var{port} is a binary output port and the current position is set
beyond the current end of the data in the underlying data sink, the
object is not extended until new data is written at that position.  The
contents of any intervening positions are unspecified.  Binary ports
created by @func{open-file-output-port} and
@func{open-file-input/output-port} can always be extended in this manner
within the limits of the underlying operating system.  In other cases,
attempts to set the port beyond the current end of data in the
underlying object may result in an exception with condition type
@code{&i/o-invalid-position}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure close-port @var{port}
Closes the port, rendering the port incapable of delivering or accepting
data. If @var{port} is an output port, it is flushed before being
closed.  This has no effect if the port has already been closed.  A
closed port is still a port.  The @func{close-port} procedure returns
unspecified values.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure call-with-port @var{port} @var{proc}
@var{proc} must accept one argument.  The @func{call-with-port}
procedure calls @var{proc} with @var{port} as an argument.  If
@var{proc} returns, @var{port} is closed automatically and the values
returned by @var{proc} are returned.  If @var{proc} does not return,
@var{port} is not closed automatically, except perhaps when it is
possible to prove that @var{port} will never again be used for an input
or output operation.
@end deffn

@node stdlib io port input ports
@subsection Input ports


An input port allows the reading of an infinite sequence of bytes or
characters punctuated by end--of--file objects.  An input port connected
to a finite data source ends in an infinite sequence of end--of--file
objects.

It is unspecified whether a character encoding consisting of several
bytes may have an end of file between the bytes.  If, for example,
@func{get-char} raises an @code{&i/o-decoding} exception because the
character encoding at the port's position is incomplete up to the next
end of file, a subsequent call to @func{get-char} may successfully
decode a character if bytes completing the encoding are available after
the end of file.


@deffn Procedure {input-port?} @var{obj}
Return @true{} if the argument is an input port (or a combined input and
output port), and returns @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {port-eof?} @var{input-port}
Return @true{} if the @func{lookahead-u8} procedure (if @var{input-port}
is a binary port) or the @func{lookahead-char} procedure (if
@var{input-port} is a textual port) would return the end--of--file
object, and @false{} otherwise.  The operation may block indefinitely if
no data is available but the port cannot be determined to be at end of
file.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {open-file-input-port} @var{filename}
@deffnx Procedure {open-file-input-port} @var{filename} @var{file-options}
@deffnx Procedure {open-file-input-port} @var{filename} @var{file-options} @var{buffer-mode}
@deffnx Procedure {open-file-input-port} @var{filename} @var{file-options} @var{buffer-mode} @var{maybe-transcoder}
@var{maybe-transcoder} must be either a transcoder or @false{}.

The @func{open-file-input-port} procedure returns an input port for the
named file.  The @var{file-options} and @var{maybe-transcoder} arguments
are optional.

The @var{file-options} argument, which may determine various aspects of
the returned port, defaults to the value of @code{(file-options)}.

The @var{buffer-mode} argument, if supplied, must be one of the symbols
that name a buffer mode.  The @var{buffer-mode} argument defaults to
@code{block}.

If @var{maybe-transcoder} is a transcoder, it becomes the transcoder
associated with the returned port.

If @var{maybe-transcoder} is @false{} or absent, the port will be a
binary port and will support the @func{port-position} and
@func{set-port-position!} operations.  Otherwise the port will be a
textual port, and whether it supports the @func{port-position} and
@func{set-port-position!} operations is implementation-dependent (and
possibly transcoder-dependent).
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {open-bytevector-input-port} @var{bytevector}
@deffnx Procedure {open-bytevector-input-port} @var{bytevector} @var{maybe-transcoder}
@var{maybe-transcoder} must be either a transcoder or @false{}.

The @func{open-bytevector-input-port} procedure returns an input port
whose bytes are drawn from @var{bytevector}.  If @var{transcoder} is
specified, it becomes the transcoder associated with the returned port.

If @var{maybe-transcoder} is @false{} or absent, the port will be a
binary port and will support the @func{port-position} and
@func{set-port-position!} operations.  Otherwise the port will be a
textual port, and whether it supports the @func{port-position} and
@func{set-port-position!} operations will be implementation--dependent
(and possibly transcoder--dependent).

If @var{bytevector} is modified after @code{open-bytevector-input-port}
has been called, the effect on the returned port is unspecified.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {open-string-input-port} @var{string}
Return a textual input port whose characters are drawn from
@var{string}.  The port may or may not have an associated transcoder; if
it does, the transcoder is implementation--dependent.  The port should
support the @func{port-position} and @func{set-port-position!}
operations.

If @var{string} is modified after @func{open-string-input-port} has been
called, the effect on the returned port is unspecified.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {standard-input-port}
Return a fresh binary input port connected to standard input.  Whether
the port supports the @func{port-position} and @func{set-port-position!}
operations is implementation--dependent.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {current-input-port}
This returns a default textual port for input.  Normally, this default
port is associated with standard input, but can be dynamically
re--assigned using the @func{with-input-from-file} procedure from the
@rsixlibrary{io simple} library.  The port may or may not have an
associated transcoder; if it does, the transcoder is
implementation--dependent.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure make-custom-binary-input-port @var{id} @var{read!} @var{get-position} @var{set-position!} @var{close}
Return a newly created binary input port whose byte source is an
arbitrary algorithm represented by the @func{read!} procedure.  @var{id}
must be a string naming the new port, provided for informational
purposes only.  @var{read!} must be a procedure and should behave as
specified below; it will be called by operations that perform binary
input.

Each of the remaining arguments may be @false{}; if any of those
arguments is not @false{}, it must be a procedure and should behave as
specified below.

@table @code
@item (@var{read!} @var{bytevector} @var{start} @var{count})
@var{start} will be a non--negative exact integer object, @var{count}
will be a positive exact integer object, and @var{bytevector} will be a
bytevector whose length is at least @var{start}+@var{count}.

The @var{read!} procedure should obtain up to @var{count} bytes from the
byte source, and should write those bytes into @var{bytevector} starting
at index @var{start}.  The @var{read!} procedure should return an exact
integer object.  This integer object should represent the number of
bytes that it has read.  To indicate an end of file, the @var{read!}
procedure should write no bytes and return 0.

@item (@var{get-position})
The @var{get-position} procedure (if supplied) should return an exact
integer object representing the current position of the input port.  If
not supplied, the custom port will not support the @func{port-position}
operation.

@item (@var{set-position!} @var{pos})
@var{pos} will be a non--negative exact integer object.  The
@var{set-position!} procedure (if supplied) should set the position of
the input port to @var{pos}.  If not supplied, the custom port will not
support the @func{set-port-position!} operation.

@item (@var{close})
The @var{close} procedure (if supplied) should perform any actions that
are necessary when the input port is closed.
@end table

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
the return values of @var{read!} and @var{get-position} only when it
actually calls them as part of an I/O operation requested by the
program.  The implementation is not required to check that these
procedures otherwise behave as described.  If they do not, however, the
behavior of the resulting port is unspecified.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure make-custom-textual-input-port @var{id} @var{read!} @var{get-position} @var{set-position!} @var{close}
Return a newly created textual input port whose character source is an

must be a string naming the new port, provided for informational
purposes only.  @var{read!} must be a procedure and should behave as

@var{start} will be a non--negative exact integer object, @var{count}
will be a positive exact integer object, and @var{string} will be a
string whose length is at least @var{start}+@var{count}.

The @var{read!} procedure should obtain up to @var{count} characters
from the character source, and should write those characters into
@var{string} starting at index @var{start}.  The @var{read!} procedure
should return an exact integer object representing the number of
characters that it has written.  To indicate an end of file, the
@var{read!}  procedure should write no bytes and return 0.

@item (@var{get-position})
The @var{get-position} procedure (if supplied) should return a single
value.  The return value should represent the current position of the
input port.  If not supplied, the custom port will not support the
@func{port-position} operation.

@item (@var{set-position!} @var{pos})
The @var{set-position!} procedure (if supplied) should set the position
of the input port to @var{pos} if @var{pos} is the return value of a
call to @var{get-position}.  If not supplied, the custom port will not
support the @func{set-port-position!} operation.

@item (@var{close})
The @var{close} procedure (if supplied) should perform any actions that

@var{maybe-transcoder} must be either a transcoder or @false{}.

The @func{open-bytevector-output-port} procedure returns two values: an

@var{proc} must accept one argument.

The @func{call-with-string-output-port} procedure creates a textual
output port that accumulates the characters written to it and calls
@var{proc} with that output port as an argument.

Whenever @var{proc} returns, a string consisting of all of the port's
accumulated characters (regardless of the port's current position) is
returned and the port is closed.

The port may or may not have an associated transcoder; if it does, the
transcoder is implementation-dependent.  The port should support the
@func{port-position} and @func{set-port-position!} operations.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure standard-output-port
@deffnx Procedure standard-error-port
Return a fresh binary output port connected to the standard output or
standard error respectively.  Whether the port supports the
@func{port-position} and @func{set-port-position!} operations is
implementation--dependent.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure current-output-port
@deffnx Procedure current-error-port
These return default textual ports for regular output and error output.
Normally, these default ports are associated with standard output, and
standard error, respectively.

The return value of @func{current-output-port} can be dynamically
re--assigned using the @func{with-output-to-file} procedure from the
@rsixlibrary{io simple} library.  A port returned by one of these
procedures may or may not have an associated transcoder; if it does, the
transcoder is implementation--dependent.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure make-custom-binary-output-port @var{id} @var{write!} @var{get-position} @var{set-position!} @var{close}
Return a newly created binary output port whose byte sink is an
arbitrary algorithm represented by the @var{write!} procedure.  @var{id}
must be a string naming the new port, provided for informational
purposes only.  @var{write!} must be a procedure and should behave as
specified below; it will be called by operations that perform binary
output.

Each of the remaining arguments may be @false{}; if any of those

specified in the description of @func{make-custom-binary-input-port}.

@table @code
@item (@var{write!} @var{bytevector} @var{start} @var{count})
@var{start} and @var{count} will be non-negative exact integer objects,
and @var{bytevector} will be a bytevector whose length is at least
@var{start}+@var{count}.

The @var{write!} procedure should write up to @var{count} bytes from
@var{bytevector} starting at index @var{start} to the byte sink.  In any
case, the @var{write!} procedure should return the number of bytes that
it wrote, as an exact integer object.
@end table

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
the return values of @var{write!} only when it actually calls
@var{write!} as part of an I/O operation requested by the program.  The
implementation is not required to check that @var{write!} otherwise
behaves as described.  If it does not, however, the behavior of the
resulting port is unspecified.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure make-custom-textual-output-port @var{id} @var{write!} @var{get-position} @var{set-position!} @var{close}

must be a string naming the new port, provided for informational
purposes only.  @var{Write!} must be a procedure and should behave as
specified below; it will be called by operations that perform textual
output.

Each of the remaining arguments may be @false{}; if any of those

@var{start} and @var{count} will be non--negative exact integer objects,
and @var{string} will be a string whose length is at least
@var{start}+@var{count}.

The @var{write!} procedure should write up to @var{count} characters
from @var{string} starting at index @var{start} to the character sink.
In any case, the @var{write!} procedure should return the number of
characters that it wrote, as an exact integer object.

@deffn Procedure put-datum @var{textual-output-port} @var{datum}
@var{datum} should be a datum value.

The @func{put-datum} procedure writes an external representation of
@var{datum} to @var{textual-output-port}.  The specific external
representation is implementation--dependent.  However, whenever
possible, an implementation should produce a representation for which
@func{get-datum}, when reading the representation, will return an object
equal (in the sense of @func{equal?}) to @var{datum}.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Not all datums may allow producing an external
representation for which @func{get-datum} will produce an object that is
equal to the original.  Specifically, NaNs contained in @var{datum} may
make this impossible.
@end quotation

@quotation
@emph{Note:} The @func{put-datum} procedure merely writes the external

@section Simple input/output


This section describes the @rsixlibrary{io simple} library, which
provides a somewhat more convenient interface for performing textual I/O
on ports.  This library implements most of the I/O procedures of the
previous revision of this report.

The ports created by the procedures of this library are textual ports
associated implementation--dependent transcoders.


@deffn Procedure {eof-object}
@deffnx Procedure {eof-object?} @var{obj}
These are the same as @func{eof-object} and @func{eof-object?} from the
@rsixlibrary{ports} library.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure call-with-input-file @var{filename} @var{proc}
@deffnx Procedure call-with-output-file @var{filename} @var{proc}
@var{proc} should accept one argument.

These procedures open the file named by @var{filename} for input or for
output, with no specified file options, and call @var{proc} with the
obtained port as an argument.

If @var{proc} returns, the port is closed automatically and the values
returned by @var{proc} are returned.

If @var{proc} does not return, the port is not closed automatically,
unless it is possible to prove that the port will never again be used
for an I/O operation.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure input-port? @var{obj}
@deffnx Procedure output-port? @var{obj}
These are the same as the @func{input-port?} and @func{output-port?}
procedures in the @rsixlibrary{io ports} library.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure current-input-port
@deffnx Procedure current-output-port
@deffnx Procedure current-error-port
These are the same as the @func{current-input-port},
@func{current-output-port}, and @func{current-error-port} procedures
from the @rsixlibrary{io ports} library.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure with-input-from-file @var{filename} @var{thunk}
@deffnx Procedure with-output-to-file @var{filename} @var{thunk}
@var{thunk} must be a procedure and must accept zero arguments.

The file is opened for input or output using empty file options, and
@var{thunk} is called with no arguments.

During the dynamic extent of the call to @var{thunk}, the obtained port
is made the value returned by @func{current-input-port} or
@func{current-output-port} procedures; the previous default values are
reinstated when the dynamic extent is exited.

When @var{thunk} returns, the port is closed automatically.  The values
returned by @var{thunk} are returned.

If an escape procedure is used to escape back into the call to
@var{thunk} after @var{thunk} is returned, the behavior is unspecified.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure open-input-file @var{filename}
Open @var{filename} for input, with empty file options, and returns the
obtained port.

@deffn Procedure open-output-file @var{filename}
Open @var{filename} for output, with empty file options, and returns the
obtained port.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure close-input-port @var{input-port}
@deffnx Procedure close-output-port @var{output-port}
Close @var{input-port} or @var{output-port}, respectively.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure read-char
@deffnx Procedure read-char @var{textual-input-port}
Reads from @var{textual-input-port}, blocking as necessary until a
character is available from @var{textual-input-port}, or the data that
are available cannot be the prefix of any valid encoding, or an end of
file is reached.

If a complete character is available before the next end of file,
@func{read-char} returns that character, and updates the input port to
point past that character.

If an end of file is reached before any data are read, @func{read-char}
returns the end--of--file object.

If @var{textual-input-port} is omitted, it defaults to the value
returned by @func{current-input-port}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure peek-char
@deffnx Procedure peek-char @var{textual-input-port}
This is the same as @func{read-char}, but does not consume any data from
the port.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure read
@deffnx Procedure read @var{textual-input-port}
Read an external representation from @var{textual-input-port} and
returns the datum it represents.

The @func{read} procedure operates in the same way as @func{get-datum}.

If @var{textual-input-port} is omitted, it defaults to the value
returned by @func{current-input-port}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure write-char @var{char}
@deffnx Procedure write-char @var{char} @var{textual-output-port}
Write an encoding of the character @var{char} to the
@var{textual-output-port}, and returns unspecified values.

If @var{textual-output-port} is omitted, it defaults to the value
returned by @func{current-output-port}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure newline
@deffnx Procedure newline @var{textual-output-port}
This is equivalent to using @func{write-char} to write @code{#\linefeed}
to @var{textual-output-port}.

If @var{textual-output-port} is omitted, it defaults to the value
returned by @func{current-output-port}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure display @var{obj}
@deffnx Procedure display @var{obj} @var{textual-output-port}
Write a representation of @var{obj} to the given
@var{textual-output-port}.

Strings that appear in the written representation are not enclosed in
doublequotes, and no characters are escaped within those strings.

Character objects appear in the representation as if written by
@func{write-char} instead of by @code{write}.

The @func{display} procedure returns unspecified values.

The @var{textual-output-port} argument may be omitted, in which case it
defaults to the value returned by @func{current-output-port}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure write @var{obj}
@deffnx Procedure write @var{obj} @var{textual-output-port}
Write the external representation of @var{obj} to
@var{textual-output-port}.

@section Bitwise operations


A number of procedures operate on the binary two's--complement
representations of exact integer objects: Bit positions within an exact
integer object are counted from the right, i.e. bit 0 is the least
significant bit.  Some procedures allow extracting @emph{bit fields},
i.e., number objects representing subsequences of the binary
representation of an exact integer object.  Bit fields are always
positive, and always defined using a finite number of bits.

@node stdlib arithmetics fixnum
@section Fixnums


Every implementation must define its fixnum range as a closed interval:

@example
[-2^(w-1), 2^(w-1)-1]
@end example

@noindent
such that @emph{w} is a (mathematical) integer @emph{w >= 24}.  Every
mathematical integer within an implementation's fixnum range must
correspond to an exact integer object that is representable within the
implementation.  A fixnum is an exact integer object whose value lies
within this fixnum range.

This section describes the @rsixlibrary{arithmetic fixnums} library,
which defines various operations on fixnums.  Fixnum operations perform
integer arithmetic on their fixnum arguments, but raise an exception
with condition type @code{&implementation-restriction} if the result is
not a fixnum.

This section uses @var{fx}, @vari{fx}, @varii{fx}, etc., as names for
arguments that must be fixnums.


@deffn Procedure fixnum? @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is an exact integer object within the fixnum
range, @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure fixnum-width
@deffnx Procedure least-fixnum
@deffnx Procedure greatest-fixnum
These procedures return @emph{w}, @emph{-2^(w-1)} and @emph{2^(w-1)-1}:
the width, minimum and the maximum value of the fixnum range,
respectively.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fx=?} @vari{fx} @varii{fx} @variii{fx} @dots{}

@deffnx Procedure {fx>=?} @vari{fx} @varii{fx} @variii{fx} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {fx<=?} @vari{fx} @varii{fx} @variii{fx} @dots{}
These procedures return @true{} if their arguments are (respectively):
equal, monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, monotonically
nondecreasing, or monotonically nonincreasing, @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxzero?} @var{fx}
@deffnx Procedure {fxpositive?} @var{fx}
@deffnx Procedure {fxnegative?} @var{fx}
@deffnx Procedure {fxodd?} @var{fx}
@deffnx Procedure {fxeven?} @var{fx}
These numerical predicates test a fixnum for a particular property,
returning @true{} or @false{}.  The five properties tested by these
procedures are: whether the number object is zero, greater than zero,
less than zero, odd, or even.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxmax} @vari{fx} @varii{fx} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {fxmin} @vari{fx} @varii{fx} @dots{}
These procedures return the maximum or minimum of their arguments.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fx+} @vari{fx} @varii{fx}
@deffnx Procedure {fx*} @vari{fx} @varii{fx}
These procedures return the sum or product of their arguments, provided
that sum or product is a fixnum.  An exception with condition type
@code{&implementation-restriction} is raised if that sum or product is
not a fixnum.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fx-} @vari{fx} @varii{fx}
@deffnx Procedure {fx-} @var{fx}
With two arguments, this procedure returns the difference
@vari{fx}-@varii{fx}, provided that difference is a fixnum.

With one argument, this procedure returns the additive inverse of its
argument, provided that integer object is a fixnum.

An exception with condition type @code{&implementation-restriction} is
raised if the mathematically correct result of this procedure is not a
fixnum.

@example
(fx- (least-fixnum))  => exception &assertion
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxdiv-and-mod} @vari{fx} @varii{fx}
@deffnx Procedure {fxdiv} @vari{fx} @varii{fx}

@deffnx Procedure {fxdiv0} @vari{fx} @varii{fx}
@deffnx Procedure {fxmod0} @vari{fx} @varii{fx}
@varii{fx} must be nonzero.

These procedures implement number--theoretic integer division and return
the results of the corresponding mathematical operations specified in
report section``Integer division''.

@example

@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxand} @vari{fx} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {fxior} @vari{fx} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {fxxor} @vari{fx} @dots{}
These procedures return the fixnum that is the bit--wise ``and'',
``inclusive or'', or ``exclusive or'' of the two's complement
representations of their arguments.  If they are passed only one
argument, they return that argument.  If they are passed no arguments,
they return the fixnum (either @emph{-1} or @emph{0}) that acts as
identity for the operation.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxif} @vari{fx} @varii{fx} @variii{fx}
Return the fixnum that is the bit--wise ``if'' of the two's complement
representations of its arguments, i.e. for each bit, if it is 1 in
@vari{fx}, the corresponding bit in @varii{fx} becomes the value of the
corresponding bit in the result, and if it is 0, the corresponding bit
in @variii{fx} becomes the corresponding bit in the value of the result.
This is the fixnum result of the following computation:

       (fxand (fxnot @vari{fx}) @variii{fx}))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxbit-count} @var{fx}
If @var{fx} is non--negative, this procedure returns the number of 1

(fxnot (fxbit-count (fxnot @var{ei})))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxlength} @var{fx}
Return the number of bits needed to represent @var{fx} if it is
positive, and the number of bits needed to represent @code{(fxnot
@var{fx})} if it is negative, which is the fixnum result of the
following computation:

@example
(do ((result 0 (+ result 1))
     (bits (if (fxnegative? @var{fx})
               (fxnot @var{fx})
               @var{fx})
           (fxarithmetic-shift-right bits 1)))
    ((fxzero? bits)
     result))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxfirst-bit-set} @var{fx}
Return the index of the least significant 1 bit in the two's complement
representation of @var{fx}.  If @var{fx} is 0, then -1 is returned.

@example
(fxfirst-bit-set 0)        =>  -1
(fxfirst-bit-set 1)        =>  0
(fxfirst-bit-set -4)       =>  2
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxbit-set?} @vari{fx} @varii{fx}
@varii{fx} must be non--negative and less than @code{(fixnum-width)}.

The @func{fxbit-set?} procedure returns @true{} if the @varii{fx}th bit
is 1 in the two's complement representation of @vari{fx}, and @false{}
otherwise.  This is the fixnum result of the following computation:

@example
(not
  (fxzero?
    (fxand @vari{fx}
           (fxarithmetic-shift-left 1 @varii{fx}))))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxcopy-bit} @vari{fx} @varii{fx} @variii{fx}
@varii{fx} must be non--negative and less than @code{(fixnum-width)}.
@variii{Fx} must be 0 or 1.

The @func{fxcopy-bit} procedure returns the result of replacing the
@varii{fx}th bit of @vari{fx} by @variii{fx}, which is the result of the
following computation:

@example
(let* ((mask (fxarithmetic-shift-left 1 @varii{fx})))
  (fxif mask
        (fxarithmetic-shift-left @variii{fx} @varii{fx})
        @vari{fx}))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxbit-field} @vari{fx} @varii{fx} @variii{fx}
@varii{fx} and @variii{fx} must be non-negative and less than
@code{(fixnum-width)}.  Moreover, @varii{fx} must be less than or equal
to @variii{fx}.

The @code{fxbit-field} procedure returns the number represented by the
bits at the positions from @varii{fx} (inclusive) to @variii{fx}
(exclusive), which is the fixnum result of the following computation:

@example
(let* ((mask (fxnot
              (fxarithmetic-shift-left -1 @variii{fx}))))
  (fxarithmetic-shift-right (fxand @vari{fx} mask)
                            @varii{fx}))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxcopy-bit-field} @vari{fx} @varii{fx} @variii{fx} @variv{fx}
@varii{fx} and @variii{fx} must be non-negative and less than
@code{(fixnum-width)}.  Moreover, @varii{fx} must be less than or equal
to @variii{fx}.

The @func{fxcopy-bit-field} procedure returns the result of replacing in
@vari{fx} the bits at positions from @varii{fx} (inclusive) to
@variii{fx} (exclusive) by the bits in @variv{fx} from position 0
(inclusive) to position @variii{fx}-@varii{fx} (exclusive), which is the
fixnum result of the following computation:

@example
(let* ((to    @vari{fx})
       (start @varii{fx})
       (end   @variii{fx})
       (from  @variv{fx})
       (mask1 (fxarithmetic-shift-left -1 start))
       (mask2 (fxnot (fxarithmetic-shift-left -1 end)))
       (mask  (fxand mask1 mask2))
       (mask3 (fxnot (fxarithmetic-shift-left -1 (- end start)))))
  (fxif mask
        (fxarithmetic-shift-left (fxand from mask3)
                                 start)
        to))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxarithmetic-shift} @vari{fx} @varii{fx}
The absolute value of @varii{fx} must be less than
@code{(fixnum-width)}.

If:

@example
(floor (* @vari{fx} (expt 2 @varii{fx})))
@end example

@noindent
is a fixnum, then that fixnum is returned.  Otherwise an exception with
condition type @code{&implementation-restriction} is raised.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxarithmetic-shift-left} @vari{fx} @varii{fx}
@deffnx Procedure {fxarithmetic-shift-right} @vari{fx} @varii{fx}
@varii{fx} must be non--negative, and less than @code{(fixnum-width)}.


The @func{fxarithmetic-shift-left} procedure behaves the same as
@func{fxarithmetic-shift}, and @code{(fxarithmetic-shift-right @vari{fx}
@varii{fx})} behaves the same as @code{(fxarithmetic-shift @vari{fx}
(fx- @varii{fx}))}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxrotate-bit-field} @vari{fx} @varii{fx} @variii{fx} @variv{fx}
@varii{fx}, @variii{fx}, and @variv{fx} must be non--negative and less
than @code{(fixnum-width)}.  @varii{fx} must be less than or equal to
@variii{fx}.  @variv{fx} must be less than the difference between
@variii{fx} and @varii{fx}.

The @func{fxrotate-bit-field} procedure returns the result of cyclically
permuting in @vari{fx} the bits at positions from @varii{fx} (inclusive)
to @variii{fx} (exclusive) by @variv{fx} bits towards the more
significant bits, which is the result of the following computation:

@example
(let* ((n     @vari{fx})
       (start @varii{fx})
       (end   @variii{fx})
       (count @variv{fx})
       (width (fx- end start)))
  (if (fxpositive? width)
      (let* ((count (fxmod count width))
             (field0
               (fxbit-field n start end))
             (field1
               (fxarithmetic-shift-left
                 field0 count))
             (field2
               (fxarithmetic-shift-right
                 field0 (fx- width count)))
             (field (fxior field1 field2)))
        (fxcopy-bit-field n start end field))
      n))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fxreverse-bit-field} @vari{fx} @varii{fx} @variii{fx}
@varii{fx} and @variii{fx} must be non-negative and less than
@code{(fixnum-width)}.  Moreover, @varii{fx} must be less than or equal
to @variii{fx}.

The @code{fxreverse-bit-field} procedure returns the fixnum obtained
from @vari{fx} by reversing the order of the bits at positions from
@varii{fx} (inclusive) to @variii{fx} (exclusive).

@example
(fxreverse-bit-field #b1010010 1 4)       =>  88 ; #b1011000
@end example

@section Flonums


This section describes the @rsixlibrary{arithmetic flonums} library.

This section uses @var{fl}, @vari{fl}, @varii{fl}, etc., as parameter
names for arguments that must be flonums, and @var{ifl} as a name for
arguments that must be integer--valued flonums, i.e., flonums for which
the @func{integer-valued?} predicate returns true.


@deffn Procedure {flonum?} @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a flonum, @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {real->flonum} @var{x}
Return the best flonum representation of @var{x}.

The value returned is a flonum that is numerically closest to the
argument.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} If flonums are represented in binary floating point, then
implementations should break ties by preferring the floating--point
representation whose least significant bit is zero.
@end quotation
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fl=?} @vari{fl} @varii{fl} @variii{fl} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {fl<?} @vari{fl} @varii{fl} @variii{fl} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {fl<=?} @vari{fl} @varii{fl} @variii{fl} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {fl>?} @vari{fl} @varii{fl} @variii{fl} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {fl>=?} @vari{fl} @varii{fl} @variii{fl} @dots{}
These procedures return @true{} if their arguments are (respectively):
equal, monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, monotonically
nondecreasing, or monotonically nonincreasing, @false{} otherwise.
These predicates must be transitive.

@example
(fl=? +inf.0 +inf.0)           => #t
(fl=? -inf.0 +inf.0)           => #f
(fl=? -inf.0 -inf.0)           => #t
(fl=? 0.0 -0.0)                => #t
(fl<? 0.0 -0.0)                => #f

(fl<? +nan.0 @var{fl})         => #f
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {flinteger?} @var{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {flzero?} @var{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {flpositive?} @var{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {flnegative?} @var{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {flodd?} @var{ifl}
@deffnx Procedure {fleven?} @var{ifl}
@deffnx Procedure {flfinite?} @var{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {flinfinite?} @var{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {flnan?} @var{fl}
These numerical predicates test a flonum for a particular property,
returning @true{} or @false{}:

@table @func
@item flinteger?
procedure tests whether the number object is an integer,

@item flzero?
tests whether it is @func{fl=?} to zero,

@item flpositive?
tests whether it is greater than zero,

@item flnegative?
tests whether it is less than zero,

@item flodd?
tests whether it is odd,

@item fleven?
tests whether it is even,

@item flfinite?
tests whether it is not an infinity and not a NaN,

@item flinfinite?
tests whether it is an infinity,

@item flnan?
tests whether it is a NaN.
@end table

@example
(flnegative? -0.0)              => #f
(flfinite?   +inf.0)            => #f
(flfinite?   5.0)               => #t
(flinfinite? 5.0)               => #f
(flinfinite? +inf.0)            => #t
@end example

@quotation
@emph{Note:} @code{(flnegative? -0.0)} must return @false{}, else it
would lose the correspondence with @code{(fl< -0.0 0.0)}, which is
@false{} according to @ieee{} 754.
@end quotation
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {flmax} @vari{fl} @varii{fl} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {flmin} @vari{fl} @varii{fl} @dots{}
These procedures return the maximum or minimum of their arguments.  They
always return a NaN when one or more of the arguments is a NaN.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fl+} @vari{fl} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {fl*} @vari{fl} @dots{}
These procedures return the flonum sum or product of their flonum
arguments.  In general, they should return the flonum that best
approximates the mathematical sum or product.  (For implementations that
represent flonums using @ieee{} binary floating point, the meaning of
``best'' is defined by the @ieee{} standards.)

@example
(fl+ +inf.0 -inf.0)             =>  +nan.0
(fl+ +nan.0 @var{fl})           =>  +nan.0
(fl* +nan.0 @var{fl})           =>  +nan.0
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fl-} @vari{fl} @varii{fl} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {fl-} @var{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {fl/} @vari{fl} @varii{fl} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure {fl/} @var{fl}
With two or more arguments, these procedures return the flonum
difference or quotient of their flonum arguments, associating to the
left.

With one argument, however, they return the additive or multiplicative
flonum inverse of their argument.

In general, they should return the flonum that best approximates the
mathematical difference or quotient.  (For implementations that
represent flonums using @ieee{} binary floating point, the meaning of
``best'' is reasonably well--defined by the @ieee{} standards.)

@example
(fl- +inf.0 +inf.0)      =>  +nan.0
@end example

For undefined quotients, @func{fl/} behaves as specified by the @ieee{}
standards:

@example
(fl/ 1.0 0.0)                   => +inf.0
(fl/ -1.0 0.0)                  => -inf.0
(fl/ 0.0 0.0)                   => +nan.0
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {flabs} @var{fl}
Return the absolute value of @var{fl}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fldiv-and-mod} @vari{fl} @varii{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {fldiv} @vari{fl} @varii{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {flmod} @vari{fl} @varii{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {fldiv0-and-mod0} @vari{fl} @varii{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {fldiv0} @vari{fl} @varii{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {flmod0} @vari{fl} @varii{fl}
These procedures implement number--theoretic integer division and return
the results of the corresponding mathematical operations specified in
report section @ref{baselib math semantics integer,Integer division}.

In the cases where the mathematical requirements in section
@ref{baselib math semantics,Semantics of common operations} cannot be
satisfied by any number object, either an exception is raised with
condition type @code{&implementation-restriction}, or unspecified
flonums (one for @func{fldiv}, @func{flmod}, @func{fldiv0} and
@func{flmod0}, two for @func{fldiv-and-mod} and @func{fldiv0-and-mod0})
are returned.

@example
(fldiv @vari{fl} @varii{fl})         => @vari{fl} div @varii{fl}
(flmod @vari{fl} @varii{fl})         => @vari{fl} mod @varii{fl}
(fldiv-and-mod @vari{fl} @varii{fl}) => @vari{fl} div @varii{fl}, @vari{fl} mod @varii{fl}
                                        ; two return values
(fldiv0 @vari{fl} @varii{fl})        => @vari{fl} div_0 @varii{fl}
(flmod0 @vari{fl} @varii{fl})        => @vari{fl} mod_0 @varii{fl}
(fldiv0-and-mod0 @vari{fl} @varii{fl})
=> @vari{fl} div_0 @varii{fl}, @vari{fl} mod_0 @varii{fl}
   ; two return values
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {flnumerator} @var{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {fldenominator} @var{fl}
These procedures return the numerator or denominator of @var{fl} as a
flonum; the result is computed as if @var{fl} was represented as a
fraction in lowest terms.  The denominator is always positive.  The
denominator of 0.0 is defined to be 1.0.

@example
(flnumerator +inf.0)           =>  +inf.0
(flnumerator -inf.0)           =>  -inf.0
(fldenominator +inf.0)         =>  1.0
(fldenominator -inf.0)         =>  1.0
(flnumerator 0.75)             =>  3.0 ; probably
(fldenominator 0.75)           =>  4.0 ; probably
@end example

Implementations should implement following behavior:

@example
(flnumerator -0.0)             => -0.0
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {flfloor} @var{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {flceiling} @var{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {fltruncate} @var{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {flround} @var{fl}
These procedures return integral flonums for flonum arguments that are
not infinities or NaNs.

@table @func
@item flfloor
Returns the largest integral flonum not larger than @var{fl}.

@item flceiling
Returns the smallest integral flonum not smaller than @var{fl}.

@item fltruncate
Returns the integral flonum closest to @var{fl} whose absolute value is
not larger than the absolute value of @var{fl}.

@item flround
Returns the closest integral flonum to @var{fl}, rounding to even when
@var{fl} represents a number halfway between two integers.
@end table

Although infinities and NaNs are not integer objects, these procedures
return an infinity when given an infinity as an argument, and a NaN when
given a NaN:

@example
(flfloor +inf.0)                       =>  +inf.0
(flceiling -inf.0)                     =>  -inf.0
(fltruncate +nan.0)                    =>  +nan.0
@end example
@end deffn

@deffnx Procedure {flacos} @var{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {flatan} @var{fl}
@deffnx Procedure {flatan} @vari{fl} @varii{fl}
These procedures compute the usual transcendental functions.

@table @func
@item flexp
Computes the base-E exponential of @var{fl}.

@item fllog
With a single argument computes the natural logarithm of @var{fl} (not
the base ten logarithm); @code{(fllog @vari{fl} @varii{fl})} computes
the base--@varii{fl} logarithm of @vari{fl}.

@item flasin
@itemx flacos
@item flatan
Compute arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent, respectively.  @code{(flatan
@vari{fl} @varii{fl})} computes the arc tangent of @vari{fl}/@varii{fl}.
@end table

See report section @ref{baselib math ops trascend,Transcendental
functions} for the underlying mathematical operations.  In the event
that these operations do not yield a real result for the given
arguments, the result may be a NaN, or may be some unspecified flonum.

Implementations that use @ieee{} binary floating--point arithmetic
should follow the relevant standards for these procedures.

@example
(flexp +inf.0)                => +inf.0
(flexp -inf.0)                => 0.0
(fllog +inf.0)                => +inf.0
(fllog 0.0)                   => -inf.0
(fllog -0.0)                  => unspecified ; if -0.0 is distinguished
(fllog -inf.0)                => +nan.0
(flatan -inf.0)               => -1.5707963267948965  ; approximately
(flatan +inf.0)               => 1.5707963267948965   ; approximately
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {flsqrt} @var{fl}
Returns the principal square root of @var{fl}. For -0.0, @func{flsqrt}
should return -0.0; for other negative arguments, the result may be a
NaN or some unspecified flonum.

@example
(flsqrt +inf.0)               => +inf.0
(flsqrt -0.0)                 => -0.0
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {flexpt} @vari{fl} @varii{fl}
Either @vari{fl} should be non--negative, or, if @vari{fl} is negative,
@varii{fl} should be an integer object.

The @func{flexpt} procedure returns @vari{fl} raised to the power
@varii{fl}.  If @vari{fl} is negative and @varii{fl} is not an integer
object, the result may be a NaN, or may be some unspecified flonum.

If @vari{fl} and @varii{fl} are both zero, the result is @code{1.0}.  If
@vari{fl} is zero and @varii{fl} is positive, the result is zero.  If
@vari{fl} is negative, the result may be a NaN, or may be some
unspecified flonum.
@end deffn

@deffnx {Condition Type} {&no-nans}
@deffnx Procedure {make-no-nans-violation}
@deffnx Procedure {no-nans-violation?} @var{obj}
These condition types could be defined by the following code:

@example
(define-condition-type &no-infinities
    &implementation-restriction
  make-no-infinities-violation
  no-infinities-violation?)

(define-condition-type &no-nans
    &implementation-restriction
  make-no-nans-violation no-nans-violation?)
@end example

These types describe that a program has executed an arithmetic
operations that is specified to return an infinity or a NaN,
respectively, on a Scheme implementation that is not able to represent
the infinity or NaN.  @ref{baselib math infinities,Representability of
infinities and NaNs}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {fixnum->flonum} @var{fx}
Return a flonum that is numerically closest to @var{fx}.

precision.

@section Exact bitwise arithmetic


This section describes the @rsixlibrary{arithmetic bitwise} library.
The exact bitwise arithmetic provides generic operations on exact
integer objects.  This section uses @var{ei}, @vari{ei}, @varii{ei},
etc., as parameter names that must be exact integer objects.


@deffn Procedure bitwise-not @var{ei}
Returns the exact integer object whose two's complement representation
is the one's complement of the two's complement representation of
@var{ei}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure bitwise-and @vari{ei} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure bitwise-ior @vari{ei} @dots{}
@deffnx Procedure bitwise-xor @vari{ei} @dots{}
These procedures return the exact integer object that is the bit--wise
``and'', ``inclusive or'', or ``exclusive or'' of the two's complement
representations of their arguments.  If they are passed only one
argument, they return that argument.  If they are passed no arguments,
they return the integer object (either -1 or 0) that acts as identity
for the operation.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure bitwise-if @vari{ei} @varii{ei} @variii{ei}
Return the exact integer object that is the bit-wise ``if'' of the two's
complement representations of its arguments, i.e. for each bit, if it is
1 in @vari{ei}, the corresponding bit in @varii{ei} becomes the value of
the corresponding bit in the result, and if it is 0, the corresponding
bit in @variii{ei} becomes the corresponding bit in the value of the
result.  This is the result of the following computation:

@example
(bitwise-ior (bitwise-and @vari{ei} @varii{ei})
             (bitwise-and (bitwise-not @vari{ei}) @variii{ei}))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure bitwise-bit-count @var{ei}
If @var{ei} is non--negative, this procedure returns the number of 1
bits in the two's complement representation of @var{ei}.  Otherwise it
returns the result of the following computation:

@example
(bitwise-not (bitwise-bit-count (bitwise-not @var{ei})))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure bitwise-length @var{ei}
Return the number of bits needed to represent @var{ei} if it is
positive, and the number of bits needed to represent @code{(bitwise-not

the result of the following computation:

@example
(do ((result 0 (+ result 1))

@node stdlib syntax-case hygiene
@section Hygiene


Barendregt's @emph{hygiene condition} for the lambda calculus is an
informal notion that requires the free variables of an expression
@emph{N} that is to be substituted into another expression @emph{M} not
to be captured by bindings in @emph{M} when such capture is not
intended.

Kohlbecker, et al. propose a corresponding @emph{hygiene condition for
macro expansion} that applies in all situations where capturing is not
explicit: ``Generated identifiers that become binding instances in the
completely expanded program must only bind variables that are generated
at the same transcription step''.  In the terminology of this document,
the ``generated identifiers'' are those introduced by a transformer
rather than those present in the form passed to the transformer, and a
``macro transcription step'' corresponds to a single call by the
expander to a transformer.  Also, the hygiene condition applies to all
introduced bindings rather than to introduced variable bindings alone.

This leaves open what happens to an introduced identifier that appears
outside the scope of a binding introduced by the same call.  Such an
identifier refers to the lexical binding in effect where it appears
(within a @code{syntax} @hyper{template}) inside the transformer body or
one of the helpers it calls.  This is essentially the referential
transparency property described by Clinger and Rees.  Thus, the hygiene
condition can be restated as follows:

@quotation
A binding for an identifier introduced into the output of a transformer
call from the expander must capture only references to the identifier
introduced into the output of the same transformer call.

A reference to an identifier introduced into the output of a transformer
refers to the closest enclosing binding for the introduced identifier
or, if it appears outside of any enclosing binding for the introduced
identifier, the closest enclosing lexical binding where the identifier
appears (within a @code{syntax} @hyper{template}) inside the transformer
body or one of the helpers it calls.
@end quotation

Explicit captures are handled via @func{datum->syntax}.

Operationally, the expander can maintain hygiene with the help of
@emph{marks}.  Marks are applied selectively by the expander to the
output of each transformer it invokes, and substitutions are applied to
the portions of each binding form that are supposed to be within the
scope of the bound identifiers.  Marks are used to distinguish
like--named identifiers that are introduced at different times (either
present in the source or introduced into the output of a particular
transformer call), and substitutions are used to map identifiers to
their expand-time values.

Each time the expander encounters a macro use, it applies an
@emph{antimark} to the input form, invokes the associated transformer,
then applies a fresh mark to the output.  Marks and antimarks cancel, so
the portions of the input that appear in the output are effectively left
unmarked, while the portions of the output that are introduced are
marked with the fresh mark.

Each time the expander encounters a binding form it creates a set of
substitutions, each mapping one of the (possibly marked) bound
identifiers to information about the binding.  (For a @func{lambda}
expression, the expander might map each bound identifier to a
representation of the formal parameter in the output of the expander.
For a @func{let-syntax} form, the expander might map each bound
identifier to the associated transformer.)  These substitutions are
applied to the portions of the input form in which the binding is
supposed to be visible.

Marks and substitutions together form a @emph{wrap} that is layered on
the form being processed by the expander and pushed down toward the
leaves as necessary.  A wrapped form is referred to as a @emph{wrapped
syntax object}.  Ultimately, the wrap may rest on a leaf that represents
an identifier, in which case the wrapped syntax object is also referred
to as an @emph{identifier}.  An identifier contains a name along with
the wrap.  (Names are typically represented by symbols.)

When a substitution is created to map an identifier to an expand--time
value, the substitution records the name of the identifier and the set
of marks that have been applied to that identifier, along with the
associated expand--time value.  The expander resolves identifier
references by looking for the latest matching substitution to be applied
to the identifier, i.e., the outermost substitution in the wrap whose
name and marks match the name and marks recorded in the substitution.
The name matches if it is the same name (if using symbols, then by
@func{eq?}), and the marks match if the marks recorded with the
substitution are the same as those that appear @emph{below} the
substitution in the wrap, i.e., those that were applied @emph{before}
the substitution.  Marks applied after a substitution, i.e., appear over
the substitution in the wrap, are not relevant and are ignored.

An algebra that defines how marks and substitutions work more precisely
is given in section 2.4 of Oscar Waddell's PhD thesis.

@c page
@node stdlib syntax-case objects
@section Syntax objects


A @emph{syntax object} is a representation of a Scheme form that
contains contextual information about the form in addition to its
structure.  This contextual information is used by the expander to
maintain lexical scoping and may also be used by an implementation to
maintain source--object correlation.

A syntax object may be wrapped.  It may also be unwrapped, fully or
partially, i.e., consist of list and vector structure with wrapped
syntax objects or nonsymbol values at the leaves.  More formally, a
syntax object is:

@itemize
@item
a pair of syntax objects,

@item
a vector of syntax objects,

@item
a nonpair, nonvector, nonsymbol value, or

@item
a wrapped syntax object.
@end itemize

The distinction between the terms ``syntax object'' and ``wrapped syntax
object'' is important.  For example, when invoked by the expander, a
transformer must accept a wrapped syntax object but may return any
syntax object, including an unwrapped syntax object.

Syntax objects representing identifiers are always wrapped and are
distinct from other types of values.  Wrapped syntax objects that are
not identifiers may or may not be distinct from other types of values.


@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@c page
@node stdlib syntax-case transformers
@section Transformers


In @func{define-syntax}, @func{let-syntax}, and @func{letrec-syntax}
forms, a binding for a syntactic keyword is an expression that evaluates
to a @emph{transformer}.

A transformer is a @emph{transformation procedure} or a @emph{variable
transformer}.  A transformation procedure is a procedure that must
accept one argument, a wrapped syntax object representing the input, and
return a syntax object representing the output.  The transformer is
called by the expander whenever a reference to a keyword with which it
has been associated is found.  If the keyword appears in the car of a
list--structured input form, the transformer receives the entire
list--structured form, and its output replaces the entire form.  Except
with variable transformers (see below), if the keyword is found in any
other definition or expression context, the transformer receives a
wrapped syntax object representing just the keyword reference, and its
output replaces just the reference.  Except with variable transformers,
an exception with condition type @code{&syntax} is raised if the keyword
appears on the left--hand side of a @func{set!} expression.


@deffn Procedure make-variable-transformer @var{proc}
@var{proc} should accept one argument, a wrapped syntax object, and
return a syntax object.

The @func{make-variable-transformer} procedure creates a @emph{variable
transformer}.  A variable transformer is like an ordinary transformer
except that, if a keyword associated with a variable transformer appears
on the left--hand side of a @func{set!} expression, an exception is not
raised.  Instead, @var{proc} is called with a wrapped syntax object
representing the entire @func{set!} expression as its argument, and its
return value replaces the entire @func{set!}  expression.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
the restrictions on @var{proc} only to the extent performed by applying
it as described.  An implementation may check whether @var{proc} is an
appropriate argument before applying it.

@node stdlib syntax-case parsing
@section Parsing input and producing output


Transformers can destructure their input with @func{syntax-case} and
rebuild their output with @code{syntax}.


@deffn Syntax syntax-case @hyper{expression} (@hyper{literal} @dots{}) @hyper{syntax-case clause} @dots{}
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} _
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} {...}
Each @hyper{literal} must be an identifier.  Each @hyper{syntax-case
clause} must take one of the following two forms.

@example
(@hyper{pattern} @hyper{output expression})
(@hyper{pattern} @hyper{fender} @hyper{output expression})
@end example

@hyper{fender} and @hyper{output expression} must be
@hyper{expression}s.

A @hyper{pattern} is an identifier, constant, or one of the following.

@example
(@hyper{pattern} @dots{})
(@hyper{pattern} @hyper{pattern} @dots{} . @hyper{pattern})
(@hyper{pattern} @dots{} @hyper{pattern} @hyper{ellipsis} @hyper{pattern} @dots{})
(@hyper{pattern} @dots{} @hyper{pattern} @hyper{ellipsis} @hyper{pattern} @dots{} . @hyper{pattern})
#(@hyper{pattern} @dots{})
#(@hyper{pattern} @dots{} @hyper{pattern} @hyper{ellipsis} @hyper{pattern} @dots{})
@end example

An @hyper{ellipsis} is the identifier ``@code{...}'' (three periods).

An identifier appearing within a @hyper{pattern} may be an underscore
(@code{_}), a literal identifier listed in the list of literals
@code{(@hyper{literal} @dots{})}, or an ellipsis (@code{...}).  All
other identifiers appearing within a @hyper{pattern} are @emph{pattern
variables}.  It is a syntax violation if an ellipsis or underscore
appears in @code{(@hyper{literal} @dots{})}.

@code{_} and @code{...} are the same as in the @rsixlibrary{base}
library.

Pattern variables match arbitrary input subforms and are used to refer
to elements of the input.  It is a syntax violation if the same pattern
variable appears more than once in a @hyper{pattern}.

Underscores also match arbitrary input subforms but are not pattern
variables and so cannot be used to refer to those elements.  Multiple
underscores may appear in a @hyper{pattern}.

A literal identifier matches an input subform if and only if the input
subform is an identifier and either both its occurrence in the input
expression and its occurrence in the list of literals have the same
lexical binding, or the two identifiers have the same name and both have
no lexical binding.

A subpattern followed by an ellipsis can match zero or more elements of
the input.

More formally, an input form @emph{F} matches a pattern @emph{P} if and
only if one of the following holds:

@itemize
@item
@emph{P} is an underscore (@code{_}).

@item
@emph{P} is a pattern variable.

@item
@emph{P} is a literal identifier and @emph{F} is an equivalent
identifier in the sense of @func{free-identifier=?}.

@item
@emph{P} is of the form:

@example
(P_1 ... P_n)
@end example

@noindent
and @emph{F} is a list of @emph{n} elements that match @emph{P_1}
through @emph{P_n}.

@item
@emph{P} is of the form:

@example
(P_1 ... P_n . P_x)
@end example

@noindent
and @emph{F} is a list or improper list of @emph{n} or more elements
whose first @emph{n} elements match @emph{P_1} through @emph{P_n} and
whose @emph{n}th cdr matches @emph{P_x}.

@item
@emph{P} is of the form:

@example
(P_1 ... P_k P_e @hyper{ellipsis} P_(m+1) ... P_n)
@end example

@noindent
where @hyper{ellipsis} is the identifier @code{...}  and @emph{F} is a
proper list of @emph{n} elements whose first @emph{k} elements match
@emph{P_1} through @emph{P_k}, whose next @emph{m-k} elements each match
@emph{P_e}, and whose remaining @emph{n-m} elements match @emph{P_(m+1)}
through @emph{P_n}.

@item
@emph{P} is of the form:

@example
(P_1 ... P_k P_e @hyper{ellipsis} P_(m+1) ... P_n . P_x)
@end example

@noindent
where @hyper{ellipsis} is the identifier @code{...}  and @emph{F} is a
list or improper list of @emph{n} elements whose first @emph{k} elements
match @emph{P_1} through @emph{P_k}, whose next @emph{m-k} elements each
match @emph{P_e}, whose next @emph{n-m} elements match @emph{P_(m+1)}
through @emph{P_n}, and whose @emph{n}th and final cdr matches
@emph{P_x}.

@item
@emph{P} is of the form:

@example
#(P_1 ... P_n)
@end example

@noindent
and @emph{F} is a vector of @emph{n} elements that match @emph{P_1}
through @emph{P_n}.

@item
@emph{P} is of the form:

@example
#(P_1 ... P_k P_e @hyper{ellipsis} P_(m+1) ... P_n)
@end example

@noindent
where @hyper{ellipsis} is the identifier @code{...}  and @emph{F} is a
vector of @emph{n} or more elements whose first @emph{k} elements match
@emph{P_1} through @emph{P_k}, whose next @emph{m-k} elements each match
@emph{P_e}, and whose remaining @emph{n-m} elements match @emph{P_(m+1)}
through @emph{P_n}.

@item
@emph{P} is a pattern datum (any nonlist, nonvector, nonsymbol datum)
and @emph{F} is equal to @emph{P} in the sense of the @func{equal?}
procedure.
@end itemize

A @func{syntax-case} expression first evaluates @hyper{expression}.  It
then attempts to match the @hyper{pattern} from the first
@hyper{syntax-case clause} against the resulting value, which is
unwrapped as necessary to perform the match.  If the pattern matches the
value and no @hyper{fender} is present, @hyper{output expression} is
evaluated and its value returned as the value of the @func{syntax-case}
expression.  If the pattern does not match the value, @func{syntax-case}
tries the second @hyper{syntax-case clause}, then the third, and so on.
It is a syntax violation if the value does not match any of the
patterns.

If the optional @hyper{fender} is present, it serves as an additional
constraint on acceptance of a clause.  If the @hyper{pattern} of a given
@hyper{syntax-case clause} matches the input value, the corresponding
@hyper{fender} is evaluated.  If @hyper{fender} evaluates to a true
value, the clause is accepted; otherwise, the clause is rejected as if
the pattern had failed to match the value.  Fenders are logically a part
of the matching process, i.e., they specify additional matching
constraints beyond the basic structure of the input.

Pattern variables contained within a clause's @hyper{pattern} are bound
to the corresponding pieces of the input value within the clause's
@hyper{fender} (if present) and @hyper{output expression}.  Pattern
variables can be referenced only within @code{syntax} expressions (see
below).  Pattern variables occupy the same name space as program
variables and keywords.

If the @func{syntax-case} form is in tail context, the @hyper{output
expression}s are also in tail position.
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax syntax @hyper{template}

@quotation
@emph{Note:} @code{#'@hyper{template}} is equivalent to @code{(syntax
@hyper{template})}.
@end quotation

A @func{syntax} expression is similar to a @func{quote} expression
except that:

@enumerate
@item
the values of pattern variables appearing within @hyper{template} are
inserted into @hyper{template},

@item
contextual information associated both with the input and with the
template is retained in the output to support lexical scoping, and

@item
the value of a @func{syntax} expression is a syntax object.
@end enumerate

A @hyper{template} is a pattern variable, an identifier that is not a
pattern variable, a pattern datum, or one of the following.

@example
(@hyper{subtemplate} @dots{})
(@hyper{subtemplate} @dots{} . @hyper{template})
#(@hyper{subtemplate} @dots{})
@end example

A @hyper{subtemplate} is a @hyper{template} followed by zero or more
ellipses.

The value of a @code{syntax} form is a copy of @hyper{template} in which
the pattern variables appearing within the template are replaced with
the input subforms to which they are bound.  Pattern data and
identifiers that are not pattern variables or ellipses are copied
directly into the output.  A subtemplate followed by an ellipsis expands
into zero or more occurrences of the subtemplate.  Pattern variables
that occur in subpatterns followed by one or more ellipses may occur
only in subtemplates that are followed by (at least) as many ellipses.
These pattern variables are replaced in the output by the input subforms
to which they are bound, distributed as specified.  If a pattern
variable is followed by more ellipses in the subtemplate than in the
associated subpattern, the input form is replicated as necessary.  The
subtemplate must contain at least one pattern variable from a subpattern
followed by an ellipsis, and for at least one such pattern variable, the
subtemplate must be followed by exactly as many ellipses as the
subpattern in which the pattern variable appears.  (Otherwise, the
expander would not be able to determine how many times the subform
should be repeated in the output.)  It is a syntax violation if the
constraints of this paragraph are not met.

A template of the form @code{(@hyper{ellipsis} @hyper{template})} is
identical to @hyper{template}, except that ellipses within the template
have no special meaning.  That is, any ellipses contained within
@hyper{template} are treated as ordinary identifiers.  In particular,
the template @code{(... ...)} produces a single ellipsis.  This allows
macro uses to expand into forms containing ellipses.

The output produced by @func{syntax} is wrapped or unwrapped according
to the following rules.

@itemize
@item
the copy of @code{(@hyperi{t} .  @hyperii{t})} is a pair if @hyperi{t}
or @hyperii{t} contain any pattern variables,

@item
the copy of @code{(@hyper{t} @hyper{ellipsis})} is a list if @hyper{t}
contains any pattern variables,

@item
the copy of @code{#(@hyperi{t} ... @hypern{t})} is a vector if any of
@hyperi{t}, @dots{}, @hypern{t} contain any pattern variables, and

@item
the copy of any portion of @hyper{t} not containing any pattern
variables is a wrapped syntax object.
@end itemize

The input subforms inserted in place of the pattern variables are
wrapped if and only if the corresponding input subforms are wrapped.
@end deffn


The following definitions of @func{or} illustrate @func{syntax-case} and
@func{syntax}.  The second is equivalent to the first but uses the
@code{#'} prefix instead of the full @func{syntax} form.

  (lambda (x)
    (syntax-case x ()
      [(_) (syntax #f)]
      [(_ e) (syntax e)]
      [(_ e1 e2 e3 ...)
       (syntax (let ([t e1])
                 (if t t (or e2 e3 ...))))])))

(define-syntax or
  (lambda (x)
    (syntax-case x ()
      [(_) #'#f]
      [(_ e) #'e]
      [(_ e1 e2 e3 ...)
       #'(let ([t e1])
           (if t t (or e2 e3 ...)))])))
@end example

The examples below define @emph{identifier macros}, macro uses
supporting keyword references that do not necessarily appear in the
first position of a list--structured form.  The second example uses
@func{make-variable-transformer} to handle the case where the keyword
appears on the left-hand side of a @func{set!}  expression.

@example
(define p (cons 4 5))
(define-syntax p.car
  (lambda (x)
    (syntax-case x ()
      [(_ . rest) #'((car p) . rest)]
      [_  #'(car p)])))

p.car                                   => 4
(set! p.car 15)                         => exception &syntax

(define p (cons 4 5))
(define-syntax p.car
  (make-variable-transformer
    (lambda (x)
      (syntax-case x (set!)
        [(set! _ e) #'(set-car! p e)]
        [(_ . rest) #'((car p) . rest)]
        [_  #'(car p)]))))
(set! p.car 15)

p.car                                   => 15
p                                       => (15 . 5)

@node stdlib syntax-case identifier
@section Identifier predicates


@deffn Procedure {identifier?} @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is an identifier, i.e., a syntax object
representing an identifier, and @false{} otherwise.

The @func{identifier?} procedure is often used within a fender to verify
that certain subforms of an input form are identifiers, as in the
definition of @code{rec}, which creates self--contained recursive
objects, below.

@example
(define-syntax rec
  (lambda (x)
    (syntax-case x ()
      [(_ x e)
       (identifier? #'x)
       #'(letrec ([x e]) x)])))

(map (rec fact
       (lambda (n)
         (if (= n 0)
             1
             (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
     '(1 2 3 4 5))    => (1 2 6 24 120)

(rec 5 (lambda (x) x)) => exception &syntax
@end example
@end deffn


The procedures @func{bound-identifier=?} and @func{free-identifier=?}
each take two identifier arguments and return @true{} if their arguments
are equivalent and @false{} otherwise.  These predicates are used to
compare identifiers according to their @emph{intended use} as free
references or bound identifiers in a given context.


@deffn Procedure {bound-identifier=?} @vari{id} @varii{id}
@vari{id} and @varii{id} must be identifiers.

The procedure @func{bound-identifier=?} returns @true{} if a binding for
one would capture a reference to the other in the output of the
transformer, assuming that the reference appears within the scope of the
binding, and @false{} otherwise.

In general, two identifiers are @func{bound-identifier=?} only if both
are present in the original program or both are introduced by the same
transformer application (perhaps implicitly, see @func{datum->syntax}).

Operationally, two identifiers are considered equivalent by
@func{bound-identifier=?} if and only if they have the same name and
same marks.

The @func{bound-identifier=?} procedure can be used for detecting
duplicate identifiers in a binding construct or for other preprocessing
of a binding construct that requires detecting instances of the bound
identifiers.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {free-identifier=?} @vari{id} @varii{id}
@vari{id} and @varii{id} must be identifiers.

The @func{free-identifier=?} procedure returns @true{} if and only if
the two identifiers would resolve to the same binding if both were to
appear in the output of a transformer outside of any bindings inserted
by the transformer.  (If neither of two like--named identifiers resolves
to a binding, i.e., both are unbound, they are considered to resolve to
the same binding.)

Operationally, two identifiers are considered equivalent by
@func{free-identifier=?} if and only the topmost matching substitution
for each maps to the same binding or the identifiers have the same name
and no matching substitution.

The @func{syntax-case} and @func{syntax-rules} forms internally use
@func{free-identifier=?} to compare identifiers listed in the literals
list against input identifiers.

@example
(let ([fred 17])
  (define-syntax a
    (lambda (x)
      (syntax-case x ()
        [(_ id) #'(b id fred)])))
  (define-syntax b
    (lambda (x)
      (syntax-case x ()
        [(_ id1 id2)
         #`(list
             #,(free-identifier=? #'id1 #'id2)
             #,(bound-identifier=? #'id1 #'id2))])))
  (a fred))
=> (#t #f)
@end example

The following definition of unnamed @func{let} uses
@func{bound-identifier=?} to detect duplicate identifiers.

@example
(define-syntax let
  (lambda (x)
    (define unique-ids?
      (lambda (ls)
        (or (null? ls)
            (and (let notmem?
                        ([x (car ls)] [ls (cdr ls)])
                   (or (null? ls)
                       (and (not (bound-identifier=?
                                   x (car ls)))
                            (notmem? x (cdr ls)))))
                 (unique-ids? (cdr ls))))))
    (syntax-case x ()
      [(_ ((i v) ...) e1 e2 ...)
       (unique-ids? #'(i ...))
       #'((lambda (i ...) e1 e2 ...) v ...)])))
@end example

The argument @code{#'(i ...)} to @func{unique-ids?} is guaranteed to be
a list by the rules given in the description of @func{syntax} above.

With this definition of @func{let}:

@example
(let ([a 3] [a 4]) (+ a a))    => exception &syntax
@end example

However,

@example
(let-syntax
  ([dolet (lambda (x)
            (syntax-case x ()
              [(_ b)
               #'(let ([a 3] [b 4]) (+ a b))]))])
  (dolet a))
=> 7
@end example

@noindent
since the identifier @code{a} introduced by @func{dolet} and the
identifier @code{a} extracted from the input form are not
@func{bound-identifier=?}.

Rather than including @code{else} in the literals list as before, this
version of @func{case} explicitly tests for @code{else} using
@func{free-identifier=?}.

@example
(define-syntax case
  (lambda (x)
    (syntax-case x ()
      [(_ e0 [(k ...) e1 e2 ...] ...
              [else-key else-e1 else-e2 ...])
       (and (identifier? #'else-key)
            (free-identifier=? #'else-key #'else))
       #'(let ([t e0])
           (cond
             [(memv t '(k ...)) e1 e2 ...]
             ...
             [else else-e1 else-e2 ...]))]
      [(_ e0 [(ka ...) e1a e2a ...]
              [(kb ...) e1b e2b ...] ...)
       #'(let ([t e0])
           (cond
             [(memv t '(ka ...)) e1a e2a ...]
             [(memv t '(kb ...)) e1b e2b ...]
             ...))])))
@end example

With either definition of @func{case}, @code{else} is not recognized as
an auxiliary keyword if an enclosing lexical binding for @code{else}
exists.  For example,

@example
(let ([else @false{}])
  (case 0 [else (write "oops")]))    => exception &syntax
@end example

@noindent
since @code{else} is bound lexically and is therefore not the same
@code{else} that appears in the definition of @func{case}.

@node stdlib syntax-case conversion
@section Syntax--object and datum conversions


@deffn Procedure {syntax->datum} @var{syntax-object}
Strip all syntactic information from a syntax object and returns the
corresponding Scheme datum.

Identifiers stripped in this manner are converted to their symbolic
names, which can then be compared with @func{eq?}.  Thus, a predicate
@code{symbolic-identifier=?} might be defined as follows.

@example
(define symbolic-identifier=?
  (lambda (x y)
    (eq? (syntax->datum x)
         (syntax->datum y))))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {datum->syntax} @var{template-id} @var{datum}
@var{template-id} must be a template identifier and @var{datum} should
be a datum value.

The @func{datum->syntax} procedure returns a syntax-object
representation of @var{datum} that contains the same contextual
information as @var{template-id}, with the effect that the syntax object
behaves as if it were introduced into the code when @var{template-id}
was introduced.

The @func{datum->syntax} procedure allows a transformer to ``bend''
lexical scoping rules by creating @emph{implicit identifiers} that
behave as if they were present in the input form, thus permitting the
definition of macros that introduce visible bindings for or references
to identifiers that do not appear explicitly in the input form.  For
example, the following defines a @func{loop} expression that uses this
controlled form of identifier capture to bind the variable @code{break}
to an escape procedure within the loop body.  (The derived
@func{with-syntax} form is like @func{let} but binds pattern variables.)

@example
(define-syntax loop
  (lambda (x)
    (syntax-case x ()
      [(k e ...)
       (with-syntax
           ([break (datum->syntax #'k 'break)])
         #'(call-with-current-continuation
             (lambda (break)
               (let f () e ... (f)))))])))

(let ((n 3) (ls '()))
  (loop
    (if (= n 0) (break ls))
    (set! ls (cons 'a ls))
    (set! n (- n 1))))
=> (a a a)
@end example

Were @code{loop} to be defined as:

@example
(define-syntax loop
  (lambda (x)
    (syntax-case x ()
      [(_ e ...)
       #'(call-with-current-continuation
           (lambda (break)
             (let f () e ... (f))))])))
@end example

@noindent
the variable @code{break} would not be visible in @code{e ...}.

The datum argument @var{datum} may also represent an arbitrary Scheme
form, as demonstrated by the following definition of @func{include}.

@example
(define-syntax include
  (lambda (x)
    (define read-file
      (lambda (fn k)
        (let ([p (open-file-input-port fn)])
          (let f ([x (get-datum p)])
            (if (eof-object? x)
                (begin (close-port p) '())
                (cons (datum->syntax k x)
                      (f (get-datum p))))))))
    (syntax-case x ()
      [(k filename)
       (let ([fn (syntax->datum #'filename)])
         (with-syntax ([(exp ...)
                        (read-file fn #'k)])
           #'(begin exp ...)))])))
@end example

@code{(include "filename")} expands into a @func{begin} expression
containing the forms found in the file named by @code{"filename"}.  For
example, if the file @file{flib.ss} contains:

@example
(define f (lambda (x) (g (* x x))))
@end example

@noindent
and the file @file{glib.ss} contains:

@example
(define g (lambda (x) (+ x x)))
@end example

@noindent
the expression:

@example
(let ()
  (include "flib.ss")
  (include "glib.ss")
  (f 5))
@end example

@noindent
evaluates to @code{50}.

The definition of @func{include} uses @func{datum->syntax} to convert
the objects read from the file into syntax objects in the proper lexical
context, so that identifier references and definitions within those
expressions are scoped where the @func{include} form appears.

Using @func{datum->syntax}, it is even possible to break hygiene
entirely and write macros in the style of old Lisp macros.  The
@func{lisp-transformer} procedure defined below creates a transformer
that converts its input into a datum, calls the programmer's procedure
on this datum, and converts the result back into a syntax object scoped
where the original macro use appeared.

@example
(define lisp-transformer
  (lambda (p)
    (lambda (x)
      (syntax-case x ()
        [(kwd . rest)
         (datum->syntax #'kwd
           (p (syntax->datum x)))]))))
@end example
@end deffn

@node stdlib syntax-case temporaries
@section Generating lists of temporaries


Transformers can introduce a fixed number of identifiers into their
output simply by naming each identifier.  In some cases, however, the
number of identifiers to be introduced depends upon some characteristic
of the input expression.  A straightforward definition of @func{letrec},
for example, requires as many temporary identifiers as there are binding
pairs in the input expression.  The procedure
@func{generate-temporaries} is used to construct lists of temporary
identifiers.


@deffn Procedure generate-temporaries @var{l}
@var{l} must be be a list or syntax object representing a
list--structured form; its contents are not important.

The number of temporaries generated is the number of elements in
@var{l}.  Each temporary is guaranteed to be unique, i.e., different
from all other identifiers.

A definition of @func{letrec} equivalent to the one using
@func{syntax-rules} given in report appendix @ref{lang derived,Sample
definitions for derived forms} is shown below.

@example
(define-syntax letrec
  (lambda (x)
    (syntax-case x ()
      ((_ ((i e) ...) b1 b2 ...)
       (with-syntax
           (((t ...) (generate-temporaries #'(i ...))))
         #'(let ((i <undefined>) ...)
             (let ((t e) ...)
               (set! i t) ...
               (let () b1 b2 ...))))))))
@end example

This version uses @func{generate-temporaries} instead of recursively
defined helper to generate the necessary temporaries.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@c page
@node stdlib syntax-case derived
@section Derived forms and procedures


The forms and procedures described in this section can be defined in
terms of the forms and procedures described in earlier sections of this
chapter.


@deffn Syntax with-syntax ((@hyper{pattern} @hyper{expression}) @dots{}) @hyper{body}
The @func{with-syntax} form is used to bind pattern variables, just as
@func{let} is used to bind variables.  This allows a transformer to
construct its output in separate pieces, then put the pieces together.

Each @hyper{pattern} is identical in form to a @func{syntax-case}
pattern.  The value of each @hyper{expression} is computed and
destructured according to the corresponding @hyper{pattern}, and pattern
variables within the @hyper{pattern} are bound as with
@func{syntax-case} to the corresponding portions of the value within
@hyper{body}.

The @func{with-syntax} form may be defined in terms of
@func{syntax-case} as follows.

@example
(define-syntax with-syntax
  (lambda (x)
    (syntax-case x ()
      ((_ ((p e0) ...) e1 e2 ...)
       (syntax (syntax-case (list e0 ...) ()
                 ((p ...) (let () e1 e2 ...))))))))
@end example

The following definition of @func{cond} demonstrates the use of
@func{with-syntax} to support transformers that employ recursion
internally to construct their output.  It handles all @func{cond} clause
variations and takes care to produce one-armed @func{if} expressions
where appropriate.

@example
(define-syntax cond
  (lambda (x)
    (syntax-case x ()
      [(_ c1 c2 ...)
       (let f ([c1 #'c1] [c2* #'(c2 ...)])
         (syntax-case c2* ()
           [()
            (syntax-case c1 (else =>)
              [(else e1 e2 ...) #'(begin e1 e2 ...)]
              [(e0) #'e0]
              [(e0 => e1)
               #'(let ([t e0]) (if t (e1 t)))]
              [(e0 e1 e2 ...)
               #'(if e0 (begin e1 e2 ...))])]
           [(c2 c3 ...)
            (with-syntax ([rest (f #'c2 #'(c3 ...))])
              (syntax-case c1 (=>)
                [(e0) #'(let ([t e0]) (if t t rest))]
                [(e0 => e1)
                 #'(let ([t e0]) (if t (e1 t) rest))]
                [(e0 e1 e2 ...)
                 #'(if e0
                        (begin e1 e2 ...)
                        rest)]))]))])))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax quasisyntax @hyper{template}
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} unsyntax
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} unsyntax-splicing
The @func{quasisyntax} form is similar to @func{syntax}, but it allows
parts of the quoted text to be evaluated, in a manner similar to the
operation of @func{quasiquote} (report section @ref{baselib
quasiquotation,Quasiquotation}).

Within a @func{quasisyntax} @var{template}, subforms of @func{unsyntax}
and @func{unsyntax-splicing} forms are evaluated, and everything else is
treated as ordinary template material, as with @func{syntax}.

The value of each @func{unsyntax} subform is inserted into the output in
place of the @func{unsyntax} form, while the value of each
@func{unsyntax-splicing} subform is spliced into the surrounding list or
vector structure.  Uses of @func{unsyntax} and @func{unsyntax-splicing}
are valid only within @func{quasisyntax} expressions.

A @func{quasisyntax} expression may be nested, with each
@func{quasisyntax} introducing a new level of syntax quotation and each
@func{unsyntax} or @func{unsyntax-splicing} taking away a level of
quotation.  An expression nested within @emph{n} @func{quasisyntax}
expressions must be within @emph{n} @emph{unsyntax} or
@func{unsyntax-splicing} expressions to be evaluated.

As noted in report section @ref{lang lex datum
abbreviations,Abbreviations}, @code{#`@hyper{template}} is equivalent to
@code{(quasisyntax @hyper{template})}, @code{#,@hyper{template}} is
equivalent to @code{(unsyntax @hyper{template})}, and
@code{#,@@@hyper{template}} is equivalent to @code{(unsyntax-splicing
@hyper{template})}.

The @func{quasisyntax} keyword can be used in place of
@func{with-syntax} in many cases.  For example, the definition of
@func{case} shown under the description of @func{with-syntax} above can
be rewritten using @func{quasisyntax} as follows.

@example
(define-syntax case
  (lambda (x)
    (syntax-case x ()
      [(_ e c1 c2 ...)
       #`(let ([t e])
           #,(let f ([c1 #'c1] [cmore #'(c2 ...)])
               (if (null? cmore)
                   (syntax-case c1 (else)
                     [(else e1 e2 ...)
                      #'(begin e1 e2 ...)]
                     [((k ...) e1 e2 ...)
                      #'(if (memv t '(k ...))
                            (begin e1 e2 ...))])
                   (syntax-case c1 ()
                     [((k ...) e1 e2 ...)
                      #`(if (memv t '(k ...))
                            (begin e1 e2 ...)
                            #,(f (car cmore)
                                  (cdr cmore)))]))))])))
@end example

Uses of @func{unsyntax} and @func{unsyntax-splicing} with zero or more
than one subform are valid only in splicing (list or vector) contexts.
@code{(unsyntax @var{template} @dots{})} is equivalent to
@code{(unsyntax @var{template}) ...}, and @code{(unsyntax-splicing
@var{template} ...)} is equivalent to @code{(unsyntax-splicing
@var{template}) ...}.  These forms are primarily useful as intermediate
forms in the output of the @func{quasisyntax} expander.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Uses of @func{unsyntax} and @func{unsyntax-splicing} with
zero or more than one subform enable certain idioms, such as
@code{#,@@#,@@}, which has the effect of a doubly indirect splicing when
used within a doubly nested and doubly evaluated @func{quasisyntax}
expression, as with the nested @func{quasiquote} examples shown in
section @ref{baselib quasiquotation,Quasiquotation}.
@end quotation
@end deffn

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Any @func{syntax-rules} form can be expressed with
@func{syntax-case} by making the @func{lambda} expression and
@func{syntax} expressions explicit, and @func{syntax-rules} may be
defined in terms of @func{syntax-case} as follows.

@example
(define-syntax syntax-rules
  (lambda (x)
    (syntax-case x ()
      [(_ (lit ...) [(k . p) t] ...)
       (for-all identifier? #'(lit ... k ...))
       #'(lambda (x)
           (syntax-case x (lit ...)
             [(_ . p) #'t] ...))])))
@end example
@end quotation

@quotation
@emph{Note:} The @func{identifier-syntax} form of the base library (see
report section @ref{baselib transformers,Macro transformers}) may be
defined in terms of @func{syntax-case}, @func{syntax}, and
@func{make-variable-transformer} as follows.

@example
(define-syntax identifier-syntax
  (syntax-rules (set!)
    [(_ e)
     (lambda (x)
       (syntax-case x ()
         [id (identifier? #'id) #'e]
         [(_ x (... ...)) #'(e x (... ...))]))]
    [(_ (id exp1) ((set! var val) exp2))
     (and (identifier? #'id) (identifier? #'var))
     (make-variable-transformer
       (lambda (x)
         (syntax-case x (set!)
           [(set! var val) #'exp2]
           [(id x (... ...)) #'(exp1 x (... ...))]
           [id (identifier? #'id) #'exp1])))]))
@end example
@end quotation

@section Syntax violations


@deffn Procedure syntax-violation @var{who message form}
@deffnx Procedure syntax-violation @var{who message form subform}
@var{who} must be @false{} or a string or a symbol.  @var{message} must
be a string.  @var{form} must be a syntax object or a datum value.
@var{subform} must be a syntax object or a datum value.

The @func{syntax-violation} procedure raises an exception, reporting a
syntax violation.  @var{who} should describe the macro transformer that
detected the exception.  The @var{message} argument should describe the
violation.  @var{form} should be the erroneous source syntax object or a
datum value representing a form. The optional @var{subform} argument
should be a syntax object or datum value representing a form that more
precisely locates the violation.

If @var{who} is @false{}, @func{syntax-violation} attempts to infer an
appropriate value for the condition object (see below) as follows: When
@var{form} is either an identifier or a list-structured syntax object
containing an identifier as its first element, then the inferred value
is the identifier's symbol.  Otherwise, no value for @var{who} is
provided as part of the condition object.

The condition object provided with the exception has the following
condition types:

@itemize
@item
If @var{who} is not @false{} or can be inferred, the condition has
condition type @code{&who}, with @var{who} as the value of its field.
In that case, @var{who} should identify the procedure or entity that
detected the exception.  If it is @false{}, the condition does not have
condition type @code{&who}.

@item
The condition has condition type @code{&message}, with @var{message} as
the value of its field.

@item
The condition has condition type @code{&syntax} with @var{form} and
@var{subform} as the value of its fields.  If @var{subform} is not
provided, the value of the subform field is @false{}.

@chapter Hashtables


The @rsixlibrary{hashtables} library provides a set of operations on
hashtables.

A @emph{hashtable} is a data structure that associates keys with values.
Any object can be used as a key, provided a @emph{hash function} and a
suitable @emph{equivalence function} is available.

A hash function is a procedure that maps keys to exact integer objects.
It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the hash function
is compatible with the equivalence function, which is a procedure that
accepts two keys and returns true if they are equivalent and @false{}
otherwise.

Standard hashtables for arbitrary objects based on the @func{eq?} and
@func{eqv?} predicates (see report section @ref{baselib
predicates,Equivalence predicates}) are provided.  Also, hash functions
for arbitrary objects, strings, and symbols are provided.

This section uses the @var{hashtable} parameter name for arguments that
must be hashtables, and the @var{key} parameter name for arguments that
must be hashtable keys.

@deffn Procedure make-eq-hashtable
@deffnx Procedure make-eq-hashtable @var{k}
Return a newly allocated mutable hashtable that accepts arbitrary
objects as keys, and compares those keys with @func{eq?}.  If an
argument is given, the initial capacity of the hashtable is set to
approximately @var{k} elements.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure make-eqv-hashtable
@deffnx Procedure make-eqv-hashtable @var{k}
Return a newly allocated mutable hashtable that accepts arbitrary
objects as keys, and compares those keys with @func{eqv?}.  If an
argument is given, the initial capacity of the hashtable is set to
approximately @var{k} elements.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure make-hashtable @var{hash-function} @var{equiv}
@deffnx Procedure make-hashtable @var{hash-function} @var{equiv} @var{k}
@var{hash-function} and @var{equiv} must be procedures.
@var{hash-function} should accept a key as an argument and should return
a non--negative exact integer object.  @var{equiv} should accept two
keys as arguments and return a single value.  Neither procedure should
mutate the hashtable returned by @func{make-hashtable}.

The @func{make-hashtable} procedure returns a newly allocated mutable
hashtable using @var{hash-function} as the hash function and @var{equiv}
as the equivalence function used to compare keys.  If a third argument
is given, the initial capacity of the hashtable is set to approximately
@var{k} elements.

Both @var{hash-function} and @var{equiv} should behave like pure
functions on the domain of keys.  For example, the @func{string-hash}
and @func{string=?} procedures are permissible only if all keys are
strings and the contents of those strings are never changed so long as
any of them continues to serve as a key in the hashtable.  Furthermore,
any pair of keys for which @var{equiv} returns true should be hashed to
the same exact integer objects by @var{hash-function}.

@strong{Implementation responsibilities:} The implementation must check
the restrictions on @var{hash-function} and @var{equiv} to the extent
performed by applying them as described.

@quotation
@emph{Note:} Hashtables are allowed to cache the results of calling the
hash function and equivalence function, so programs cannot rely on the
hash function being called for every lookup or update.  Furthermore any
hashtable operation may call the hash function more than once.

@section Procedures


@deffn Procedure {hashtable?} @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a hashtable, @false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure hashtable-size @var{hashtable}
Return the number of keys contained in @var{hashtable} as an exact
integer object.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure hashtable-ref @var{hashtable} @var{key} @var{default}
Return the value in @var{hashtable} associated with @var{key}.  If
@var{hashtable} does not contain an association for @var{key},
@var{default} is returned.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {hashtable-set!} @var{hashtable} @var{key} @var{obj}
Change @var{hashtable} to associate @var{key} with @var{obj}, adding a
new association or replacing any existing association for @var{key}, and
returns unspecified values.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {hashtable-delete!} @var{hashtable} @var{key}
Remove any association for @var{key} within @var{hashtable} and returns
unspecified values.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {hashtable-contains?} @var{hashtable} @var{key}
Return @true{} if @var{hashtable} contains an association for @var{key},
@false{} otherwise.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {hashtable-update!} @var{hashtable} @var{key} @var{proc} @var{default}
@var{proc} should accept one argument, should return a single value, and
should not mutate @var{hashtable}.

The @func{hashtable-update!} procedure applies @var{proc} to the value
in @var{hashtable} associated with @var{key}, or to @var{default} if
@var{hashtable} does not contain an association for @var{key}.  The
@var{hashtable} is then changed to associate @var{key} with the value
returned by @var{proc}.

The behavior of @func{hashtable-update!} is equivalent to the following
code, but may be implemented more efficiently in cases where the
implementation can avoid multiple lookups of the same key:

@example
(hashtable-set!
  hashtable key
  (proc (hashtable-ref
         hashtable key default)))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure hashtable-copy @var{hashtable}
@deffnx Procedure hashtable-copy @var{hashtable} @var{mutable}
Return a copy of @var{hashtable}.  If the @var{mutable} argument is
provided and is true, the returned hashtable is mutable; otherwise it is
immutable.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {hashtable-clear!} @var{hashtable}
@deffnx Procedure {hashtable-clear!} @var{hashtable} @var{k}
Remove all associations from @var{hashtable} and returns unspecified
values.

If a second argument is given, the current capacity of the hashtable is
reset to approximately @var{k} elements.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure hashtable-keys @var{hashtable}
Return a vector of all keys in @var{hashtable}.  The order of the vector
is unspecified.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure hashtable-entries @var{hashtable}
Return two values, a vector of the keys in @var{hashtable}, and a vector
of the corresponding values.

Example:

@example
(let ((h (make-eqv-hashtable)))
  (hashtable-set! h 1 'one)
  (hashtable-set! h 2 'two)
  (hashtable-set! h 3 'three)
  (hashtable-entries h))
=> #(1 2 3) #(one two three) ; two return values
@end example

@noindent
the order of the entries in the result vectors is not known.

For hashtables created with @func{make-eq-hashtable} and
@func{make-eqv-hashtable}, returns @func{eq?} and @func{eqv?}
respectively.

while they remain in use as keys in the hashtable.


@deffn Procedure equal-hash @var{obj}
Return an integer hash value for @var{obj}, based on its structure and
current contents.  This hash function is suitable for use with
@func{equal?} as an equivalence function.

@emph{Note:} Like @func{equal?}, the @func{equal-hash} procedure must
always terminate, even if its arguments contain cycles.

@node stdlib enum
@chapter Enumerations


This chapter describes the @rsixlibrary{enums} library for dealing with
enumerated values and sets of enumerated values.  Enumerated values are
represented by ordinary symbols, while finite sets of enumerated values
form a separate type, known as the @emph{enumeration sets}.  The
enumeration sets are further partitioned into sets that share the same
@emph{universe} and @emph{enumeration type}.  These universes and
enumeration types are created by the @func{make-enumeration} procedure.
Each call to that procedure creates a new enumeration type.

This library interprets each enumeration set with respect to its
specific universe of symbols and enumeration type.  This facilitates
efficient implementation of enumeration sets and enables the complement
operation.

In the descriptions of the following procedures, @var{enum-set} ranges
over the enumeration sets, which are defined as the subsets of the
universes that can be defined using @func{make-enumeration}.


@deffn Procedure make-enumeration @var{symbol-list}
@var{symbol-list} must be a list of symbols.

The @func{make-enumeration} procedure creates a new enumeration type
whose universe consists of those symbols (in canonical order of their
first appearance in the list) and returns that universe as an
enumeration set whose universe is itself and whose enumeration type is
the newly created enumeration type.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure enum-set-universe @var{enum-set}
Return the set of all symbols that comprise the universe of its
argument, as an enumeration set.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure enum-set-indexer @var{enum-set}
Return a unary procedure that, given a symbol that is in the universe of
@var{enum-set}, returns its 0--origin index within the canonical
ordering of the symbols in the universe; given a symbol not in the
universe, the unary procedure returns @false{}.

@example
(let* ((e (make-enumeration '(red green blue)))
       (i (enum-set-indexer e)))
  (list (i 'red) (i 'green) (i 'blue) (i 'yellow)))
=> (0 1 2 #f)
@end example

The @func{enum-set-indexer} procedure could be defined as follows using
the @func{memq} procedure from the @rsixlibrary{lists} library:

@example
(define (enum-set-indexer set)
  (let* ((symbols (enum-set->list
                    (enum-set-universe set)))
         (cardinality (length symbols)))
    (lambda (x)
      (cond
       ((memq x symbols)
        => (lambda (probe)
             (- cardinality (length probe))))
       (else #f)))))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure enum-set-constructor @var{enum-set}
Return a unary procedure that, given a list of symbols that belong to
the universe of @var{enum-set}, returns a subset of that universe that
contains exactly the symbols in the list.  The values in the list must
all belong to the universe.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure enum-set->list @var{enum-set}
Return a list of the symbols that belong to its argument, in the
canonical order of the universe of @var{enum-set}.

@example
(let* ((e (make-enumeration '(red green blue)))
       (c (enum-set-constructor e)))
  (enum-set->list (c '(blue red))))    => (red blue)
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {enum-set-member?} @var{symbol} @var{enum-set}
@deffnx Procedure {enum-set-subset?} @vari{enum-set} @varii{enum-set}
@deffnx Procedure {enum-set=?} @vari{enum-set} @varii{enum-set}
The @func{enum-set-member?} procedure returns @true{} if its first
argument is an element of its second argument, @false{} otherwise.

The @func{enum-set-subset?} procedure returns @true{} if the universe of
@vari{enum-set} is a subset of the universe of @varii{enum-set}
(considered as sets of symbols) and every element of @vari{enum-set} is
a member of @varii{enum-set}.  It returns @false{} otherwise.

The @func{enum-set=?} procedure returns @true{} if @vari{enum-set} is a
subset of @varii{enum-set} and vice versa, as determined by the
@func{enum-set-subset?} procedure.  This implies that the universes of
the two sets are equal as sets of symbols, but does not imply that they
are equal as enumeration types.  Otherwise, @false{} is returned.

@example
(let* ((e (make-enumeration '(red green blue)))
       (c (enum-set-constructor e)))
  (list
   (enum-set-member? 'blue (c '(red blue)))
   (enum-set-member? 'green (c '(red blue)))
   (enum-set-subset? (c '(red blue)) e)
   (enum-set-subset? (c '(red blue)) (c '(blue red)))
   (enum-set-subset? (c '(red blue)) (c '(red)))
   (enum-set=? (c '(red blue)) (c '(blue red)))))
=> (#t #f #t #t #f #t)
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure enum-set-union @vari{enum-set} @varii{enum-set}
@deffnx Procedure enum-set-intersection @vari{enum-set} @varii{enum-set}
@deffnx Procedure enum-set-difference @vari{enum-set} @varii{enum-set}
@vari{enum-set} and @varii{enum-set} must be enumeration sets that have
the same enumeration type.

The @func{enum-set-union} procedure returns the union of @vari{enum-set}
and @varii{enum-set}.  The @func{enum-set-intersection} procedure
returns the intersection of @vari{enum-set} and @varii{enum-set}.  The
@func{enum-set-difference} procedure returns the difference of
@vari{enum-set} and @varii{enum-set}.

@example
(let* ((e (make-enumeration '(red green blue)))
       (c (enum-set-constructor e)))
  (list (enum-set->list
         (enum-set-union (c '(blue)) (c '(red))))
        (enum-set->list
         (enum-set-intersection (c '(red green))
                                (c '(red blue))))
        (enum-set->list
         (enum-set-difference (c '(red green))
                              (c '(red blue))))))
=> ((red blue) (red) (green))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure enum-set-complement @var{enum-set}
Return @var{enum-set}'s complement with respect to its universe.

@example
(let* ((e (make-enumeration '(red green blue)))
       (c (enum-set-constructor e)))
  (enum-set->list
    (enum-set-complement (c '(red)))))
=> (green blue)
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure enum-set-projection @vari{enum-set} @varii{enum-set}
Project @vari{enum-set} into the universe of @varii{enum-set}, dropping
any elements of @vari{enum-set} that do not belong to the universe of
@varii{enum-set}.  (If @vari{enum-set} is a subset of the universe of
its second, no elements are dropped, and the injection is returned.)

@example
(let ((e1 (make-enumeration
            '(red green blue black)))
      (e2 (make-enumeration
            '(red black white))))
  (enum-set->list
    (enum-set-projection e1 e2))))
=> (red black)
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax define-enumeration @hyper{type-name} (@hyper{symbol} @dots{}) @hyper{constructor-syntax}
The @func{define-enumeration} form defines an enumeration type and
provides two macros for constructing its members and sets of its
members.

A @func{define-enumeration} form is a definition and can appear anywhere
any other @hyper{definition} can appear.

@hyper{type-name} is an identifier that is bound as a syntactic keyword;
@hyper{symbol} @dots{} are the symbols that comprise the universe of the
enumeration (in order).

@code{(@hyper{type-name} @hyper{symbol})} checks at macro-expansion time
whether the name of @hyper{symbol} is in the universe associated with
@hyper{type-name}.  If it is, @code{(@hyper{type-name} @hyper{symbol})}
is equivalent to @code{@hyper{symbol}}.  It is a syntax violation if it
is not.

@hyper{constructor-syntax} is an identifier that is bound to a macro
that, given any finite sequence of the symbols in the universe, possibly
with duplicates, expands into an expression that evaluates to the
enumeration set of those symbols.

@code{(@hyper{constructor-syntax} @hyper{symbol} ...)} checks at
macro-expansion time whether every @hyper{symbol} ... is in the universe
associated with @hyper{type-name}.  It is a syntax violation if one or
more is not.  Otherwise:

@example
(@hyper{constructor-syntax} @hyper{symbol} ...)
@end example

@noindent
is equivalent to:

@example
((enum-set-constructor (@hyper{constructor-syntax}))
 '(@hyper{symbol} ...))
@end example

Example:

@example
(define-enumeration color
  (black white purple maroon)
  color-set)

(color black)                      => black
(color purpel)                     => exception &syntax
(enum-set->list (color-set))       => ()
(enum-set->list
  (color-set maroon white))        => (white maroon)
@end example

@quotation
@emph{Note:} In @code{(@hyper{type-name} @hyper{symbol})} and
@code{(@hyper{constructor-syntax} @hyper{symbol} ...)} forms, only the
names of the @hyper{symbol}s are significant.

@chapter Evaluation


The @rsixlibrary{eval} library allows a program to create Scheme
expressions as data at run time and evaluate them.


@deffn Procedure eval @var{expression} @var{environment}
Evaluate @var{expression} in the specified environment and returns its
value.  @var{expression} must be a syntactically valid Scheme expression
represented as a datum value, and @var{environment} must be an
@emph{environment}, which can be created using the @func{environment}
procedure described below.

If the first argument to @code{eval} is determined not to be a
syntactically correct expression, then @func{eval} must raise an
exception with condition type @code{&syntax}.  Specifically, if the
first argument to @code{eval} is a definition or a splicing @func{begin}
form containing a definition, it must raise an exception with condition
type @code{&syntax}.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure environment @var{import-spec} @dots{}
@var{import-spec} must be a datum representing an @hyper{import spec}
(see report section @ref{lang library form,Library form}).

The @func{environment} procedure returns an environment corresponding to
@var{import-spec}.

The bindings of the environment represented by the specifier are
immutable: If @func{eval} is applied to an expression that is determined
to contain an assignment to one of the variables of the environment,
then @func{eval} must raise an exception with a condition type
@code{&syntax}.

@chapter Mutable pairs


The procedures provided by the @rsixlibrary{mutable-pairs} library allow
new values to be assigned to the car and cdr fields of previously
allocated pairs.


@deffn Procedure {set-car!} @var{pair} @var{obj}
Store @var{obj} in the car field of @var{pair}.  The @func{set-car!}
procedure returns unspecified values.

@example

If an immutable pair is passed to @func{set-car!}, an exception with
condition type @code{&assertion} should be raised.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure {set-cdr!} @var{pair} @var{obj}
Store @var{obj} in the cdr field of @var{pair}.  The @func{set-cdr!}

@chapter Mutable strings


The @func{string-set!} procedure provided by the
@rsixlibrary{mutable-strings} library allows mutating the characters of
a string in--place.


@deffn Procedure {string-set!} @var{string} @var{k} @var{char}
@var{k} must be a valid index of @var{string}.

The @func{string-set!} procedure stores @var{char} in element @var{k} of
@var{string} and returns unspecified values.

Passing an immutable string to @func{string-set!} should cause an
exception with condition type @code{&assertion} to be raised.

@example
(define (f) (make-string 3 #\*))
(define (g) "***")
(string-set! (f) 0 #\?)                 => unspecified
(string-set! (g) 0 #\?)                 => unspecified

(quotient @vari{n} @varii{n})   => @vari{n}/@varii{n}
(remainder @vari{n} @varii{n})  => 0
(modulo @vari{n} @varii{n})     => 0
@end example

If @vari{n}/@varii{n} is not an integer object:

@example
(quotient @vari{n} @varii{n})   => @var{n$_q$}
(remainder @vari{n} @varii{n})  => @var{n$_r$}
(modulo @vari{n} @varii{n})     => @var{n$_m$}
@end example

@noindent
where @var{n_q} is @vari{n}/@varii{n} rounded towards zero,

@example
0 < |@var{n_r}| < |@varii{n}|
0 < |@var{n_m}| < |@varii{n}|
@end example

@noindent
@var{n_r} and @var{n_m} differ from @vari{n} by a multiple of @varii{n},
@var{n_r} has the same sign as @vari{n}, and @var{n_m} has the same sign
as @varii{n}.

Consequently, for integer objects @vari{n} and @varii{n} with @varii{n}
not equal to 0,

@example
(= @vari{n} (+ (* @varii{n} (quotient @vari{n} @varii{n}))
               (remainder @vari{n} @varii{n})))
=> #t
@end example

@noindent
provided all number object involved in that computation are exact.

@example
(modulo 13 4)           =>  1
(remainder 13 4)        =>  1

(modulo -13 4)          =>  3
(remainder -13 4)       =>  -1

(modulo 13 -4)          =>  -3
(remainder 13 -4)       =>  1

(modulo -13 -4)         =>  -1
(remainder -13 -4)      =>  -1

(remainder -13 -4.0)    =>  -1.0
@end example

@quotation
@emph{Note:} These procedures could be defined in terms of @func{div}
and @func{mod} (see report section @ref{baselib math ops
arithmetic,Arithmetic operations}) as follows (without checking of the
argument types):

@example
(define (sign n)
  (cond
    ((negative? n) -1)
    ((positive? n) 1)
    (else 0)))

(define (quotient n1 n2)
  (* (sign n1) (sign n2) (div (abs n1) (abs n2))))

(define (remainder n1 n2)
  (* (sign n1) (mod (abs n1) (abs n2))))

(define (modulo n1 n2)
  (* (sign n2) (mod (* (sign n2) n1) (abs n2))))
@end example
@end quotation
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax delay @hyper{expression}
The @func{delay} construct is used together with the procedure
@func{force} to implement @emph{lazy evaluation} or @emph{call by need}.

@code{(delay @hyper{expression})} returns an object called a
@emph{promise} which at some point in the future may be asked (by the
@func{force} procedure) to evaluate @hyper{expression}, and deliver the
resulting value.  The effect of @hyper{expression} returning multiple
values is unspecified.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure force @var{promise}
@var{promise} must be a promise.

The @func{force} procedure forces the value of @var{promise}.  If no
value has been computed for the promise, then a value is computed and
returned.  The value of the promise is cached (or ``memoized'') so that
if it is forced a second time, the previously computed value is
returned.

@example
(force (delay (+ 1 2)))                 =>  3

(let ((p (delay (+ 1 2))))
  (list (force p) (force p)))           =>  (3 3)

(define a-stream
  (letrec ((next
            (lambda (n)
              (cons n (delay (next (+ n 1)))))))
    (next 0)))
(define head car)
(define tail
  (lambda (stream) (force (cdr stream))))

(head (tail (tail a-stream)))           =>  2
@end example

Promises are mainly intended for programs written in functional style.
The following examples should not be considered to illustrate good
programming style, but they illustrate the property that only one value
is computed for a promise, no matter how many times it is forced.

@example
(define count 0)
(define p
  (delay (begin (set! count (+ count 1))
                (if (> count x)
                    count
                    (force p)))))
(define x 5)
p                     =>  a promise
(force p)             =>  6
p                     =>  a promise, still
(begin (set! x 10)
       (force p))     =>  6
@end example

Here is a possible implementation of @func{delay} and @func{force}.
Promises are implemented here as procedures of no arguments, and
@func{force} simply calls its argument:

@example
(define force
  (lambda (object)
    (object)))
@end example

The expression:

@example
(delay @hyper{expression})
@end example

@noindent
has the same meaning as the procedure call:

@example
(make-promise (lambda () @hyper{expression}))
@end example

@noindent
as follows:

@example
(define-syntax delay
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((delay expression)
     (make-promise (lambda () expression)))))
@end example

@noindent
where @func{make-promise} is defined as follows:

@example
(define make-promise
  (lambda (proc)
    (let ((result-ready?  #f)
          (result         #f))
      (lambda ()
        (if result-ready?
            result
            (let ((x (proc)))
              (if result-ready?
                  result
                  (begin (set! result-ready? #t)
                         (set! result x)
                         result))))))))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure null-environment @var{n}
@var{n} must be the exact integer object 5.

The @func{null-environment} procedure returns an environment specifier
suitable for use with @func{eval} representing an environment that is
empty except for the (syntactic) bindings for all keywords described in
the previous revision of this report, including bindings for @code{=>},
@code{...}, @code{else}, and @code{_} that are the same as those in the
@rsixlibrary{base} library.
@end deffn


@deffn Procedure scheme-report-environment @var{n}
@var{n} must be the exact integer object 5.

The @func{scheme-report-environment} procedure returns an environment
specifier for an environment that is empty except for the bindings for
the identifiers described in the previous revision of this report,
omitting @func{load}, @func{interaction-environment},
@func{transcript-on}, @func{transcript-off}, and @func{char-ready?}.

The variable bindings have as values the procedures of the same names
described in this report, and the keyword bindings, including @code{=>},
@code{...}, @code{else}, and @code{_} are the same as those described in
this report.

What follows is an unofficial documentation of the foreign functions
interface implemented by Ypsilon revision 285.
@end quotation

@noindent
The high level interface is exported by the @library{ffi} library; the
low level interface is exported by the @library{core} library.  The
@library{ffi} library has everything we need for ``normal'' operations.

@section Loading shared objects


@deffn Procedure load-shared-object @var{name}
Accept as single argument a string selecting the shared object file;
return a value referencing the loaded shared object.

The string can be the name of a library's file or a pathname of the
same, absolute or relative.  On Unix--like systems the following examples
will work:

@example
(import (rnrs)
  (ffi))
(define zlib   (load-shared-object "libz.so"))
(define bzlib2 (load-shared-object "/usr/lib/libbz2.so"))
@end example

@noindent
and assuming the current working directory is @file{/usr}:

@example
(import (rnrs)
  (ffi))
(define gtk (load-shared-object "./lib/libgtk.so"))
@end example

If @func{load-shared-object} is called with an empty string as argument:
the return value references the current process.  With this value we can
access symbols exported by the current program and the libraries that
have been already loaded (this may be platform specific, check out the
documentation of your operative system).  For example: the symbols from
the standard C library, like @cfunc{fwrite}, can be accessed this way.
@end deffn


@c page
@node ffi symbols
@section Retrieving symbols


@deffn Procedure lookup-shared-object @var{shared-object} @var{symbol}
Accept as first argument the value referencing an already loaded shared
object, and as second argument a symbol or string representing the name
of a function exported by the shared object.  Return a value referencing
the exported function.

On Unix-like systems the following example will work:

@example
(import (rnrs)
  (ffi))
(define zlib (load-shared-object "libz.so"))
(define deflateInit_f (lookup-shared-object zlib 'deflateInit_))
(define deflate_f     (lookup-shared-object zlib 'deflate))
(define deflateEnd_f  (lookup-shared-object zlib 'deflateEnd))
@end example

@noindent
as we see: we have to care about the true name of the exported symbols
(when coding in the C language: we call the init function as
@cfunc{deflateInit}, but the actual exported symbol is
@cfunc{deflateInit_}).

Another example for Unix like systems: to access the C standard
@cfunc{fwrite} we do:

@example
(import (rnrs)
  (ffi))
(define self (load-shared-object ""))
(define fwrite_f (lookup-shared-object self "fwrite"))
@end example
@end deffn

@section Calling foreign functions


It is done by calling a stub procedure, provided by Ypsilon, which is
specialised to return a type of value.


@deffn Procedure {stdcall-shared-object->void} @var{pointer} . @var{args}
@deffnx Procedure {stdcall-shared-object->int} @var{pointer} . @var{args}
@deffnx Procedure {stdcall-shared-object->double} @var{pointer} . @var{args}
@deffnx Procedure {stdcall-shared-object->intptr} @var{pointer} . @var{args}
@deffnx Procedure {stdcall-shared-object->char*} @var{pointer} . @var{args}
Invoke the foreign function identified by @var{pointer}, which must be a
value previously returned by @func{lookup-shared-object}.  The other
arguments are handed to the function as parameters.

The @code{void} variant is for functions that return no value.

The @code{int} variant is for functions that return an @code{int} value.

The @code{double} variant is for functions that return a @code{double} value.

The @code{intptr} variant is for functions that return a @code{void *}
value or any other pointers different from @code{char *}.

The @code{char*} variant is for functions that return a @code{char *}
value.

Ypsilon automatically figures out how to push the arguments on the stack
and how to convert returned values, as described in @ref{ffi types}.
@end deffn


Knowing that the C language prototype of @cfunc{deflateInit} is:

@example
int deflateInit (z_streamp strm, int level);
@end example

@noindent
in which @code{z_streamp} is a pointer to structure, to call the
function we can define a wrapper like this:

@example
(import (rnrs)
  (ffi))
(define zlib (load-shared-object "libz.so"))
(define deflateInit_f (lookup-shared-object zlib 'deflateInit_))

(define (deflateInit zstream level)
  (stdcall-shared-object->int deflateInit_f zstream level))

@section Handling of type conversions

@subsection Returned values


@subsubheading Void return type


The stub procedure @func{stdcall-shared-object->void} is meant to call a
foreign function that returns nothing.

No conversion problems here, but notice that, in truth, the function
call is equal to the one performed by @func{stdcall-shared-object->int}
(see below): the returned value is simply discarded.


@subsubheading Integer return type

The stub procedure @func{stdcall-shared-object->int} is meant to call a
foreign function that returns an integer value.

It is meant to handle return values that can be stored in a
@code{intptr_t} type, which is defined in the system header
@file{stdint.h}, and it is meant to be big enough to hold both a signed
integer and a pointer.  For example: on 64 bits platforms it could be
@code{long int}, while on 32 bits platforms it could be @code{int}.

The @code{intptr_t} value is converted to integer, a fixnum or bignum.


@subsubheading Double return type

The stub procedure @func{stdcall-shared-object->double} is meant to call
a foreign function that returns a double precision floating point value.
Single precision floating point values, @code{float}, are not supported.


@subsubheading Pointer return type

The stub function @func{stdcall-shared-object->intptr} is meant to call
a foreign function that returns a generic pointer value.  Nothing
prevents us from using this stub for foreign functions that return a
@code{char *} referencing a zero--terminated string; we have the option
of using the specialised @code{stdcall-shared-object->char*} stub.

The conversion is equal to the one performed by
@func{stdcall-shared-object->int} (see above).


@subsubheading Zstring pointer return type

The stub function @func{stdcall-shared-object->char*} is meant to invoke
a foreign function that returns a @code{char *} pointer value,
referencing a zero--terminated, @ascii{} coded string.

If the pointer value is @code{NULL}: the stub returns @false{}.

If the value is non--@code{NULL}: the pointer is interpreted as of type
@code{uint8_t *} and embedded in a special bytevector structure, that
allows bytevector Scheme procedures to be applied to the array of bytes.
Notice that:

@itemize
@item
even with the bytevector interface: the array of bytes @strong{must} be
terminated by a zero byte, else the behaviour is undefined (that is:
your machine will crash and burn, because there is no way to determine
the correct length of the array);

@item
the special wrapper bytevector structure is subject to garbage
collection, but the embedded array is not; the array has to be freed
using some foreign function, like the system @cfunc{free}; see the
protocol of pointer input arguments for details.
@end itemize

The @var{wrapper} bytevector can be converted to a Scheme string with
this form:

@example
(bytevector->string wrapper (make-transcoder (utf-8-codec)))
@end example


@c page
@node ffi types input
@subsection Input arguments


@subsubheading Integer and pointer arguments

Scheme integer arguments (both fixnums and bignums) have to be converted
to values of C language type integer.

If the value is positive: an attempt is made to convert it to a value
that can be stored in a variable of type @code{uintptr_t}, which is
defined in the system header @file{stdint.h}, and it is meant to be big
enough to hold both an unsigned integer and a pointer.  For example: on
64 bits platforms it could be @code{unsigned long int}, while on 32 bits
platforms it could be @code{unsigned int}.

If the value is negative: an attempt is made to convert it to a value
that can be stored in a variable of type @code{intptr_t}, which is
defined in the system header @file{stdint.h}, and it is meant to be big
enough to hold both a signed integer and a pointer.  For example: on 64
bits platforms it could be @code{long int}, while on 32 bits platforms
it could be @code{int}.

If the number is too big, an error is raised.

Notice that pointers are represented as unsigned integers: when we use
the stub @func{stdcall-shared-object->intptr} to call a foreign function
that returns a pointer value, the returned value will be converted to a
Scheme integer.  So when we use that pointer value as argument to
foreign functions, it will be pushed on the stack as unsigned integer
(that it @code{uintptr_t}).

Possible problems:

@itemize
@item
if the foreign function wants an @code{int}, but we use a positive value
that is big enough for @code{unsigned int} but not for an @code{int}:
Ypsilon will push an @code{unsigned int}, and the foreign function will
(probably) interpret it as a negative value;

it is our responsibility keep the argument in the correct range of
values, but there may be cases in which this is impossible;

@item
there is no way to push a @code{short int} or @code{long long} on the
stack as argument.
@end itemize


@subsubheading Floating point arguments

The low level interface accepts floating point numbers in two flavors:

@enumerate
@item
Scheme flonums that internally are implemented as @code{double}; they
are cloned from the Scheme values and pushed on the stack;

@item
32 bits Scheme fixnums that are pushed on the C stack and interpreted as
@code{float} numbers; we can convert Scheme flonums to these 32 bits
fixnums with the @func{flonum->float} procedure, which is exported by
@library{core}.
@end enumerate

Possible problems:

@itemize
@item
there is no way to push a @code{long double} to the stack.
@end itemize


@subsubheading Bytevector arguments

If the argument is a common Scheme bytevector: a pointer to the first
byte of its data area is pushed on the stack.  We can trust the garbage
collector @strong{not} to finalise the bytevector during the dynamic
extent of the foreign function call, but we @strong{cannot} use a
bytevector as argument to a foreign function that will store the pointer
in some data structure.

If the argument is a wrapper Scheme bytevector used as interface to a
@code{char *} array (@ref{ffi types output,Zstring pointer return
type}): the @code{char *} pointer is pushed on the stack.  We can trust
the garbage collector not to remove the bytevector during the dynamic
extent of the foreign function call, and we @strong{can} use this kind
of bytevector as argument to a foreign function that will store the
pointer in some data structure.  But we @strong{cannot} assume that the
bytevector will have consistent state if the foreign function may
release the array, with the system @cfunc{free} or some other mean to
``release'' the block of memory.


@subsubheading Vector arguments


Scheme vectors are accepted as foreign function arguments if they have a
special format.  @fixme{The interpretation of vector is misterious.}
