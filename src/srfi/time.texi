@appendixsubsec Abstract


@noindent
Points in time are represented a the number of seconds (with nanosecond
precision) since ``the epoch'', a zero point in time.  Several standard
variants are defined, including @utc{} (Universal Coordinated Time),
@tai{} (international atomic time), and monotonic time.  A point in time
can also be represented as a Julian Day or Modified Julian Day number.

Time durations, including time spent in a process or thread, are
defined.  Conversion routines are provided.  The procedure
@func{current-time} queries the current time in a specified variant,
with a system--dependent resolution.  Procedures for time arithmetic and
time comparisons are also provided.

A date is a representation of a point in time in the Gregorian calendar,
a 24 hour clock (with nanosecond precision) and a time zone offset from
@utc{}.  Procedures for converting between time and dates are provided,
as well as for reading and writing string representations of dates.

@node srfi time spec intro
@appendixsubsubsec Introduction


@noindent
A @emph{Time} object, which is distinct from all existing types, defines
a point in time or a time duration in some standard time system.  The
standard time systems are:

@itemize
@item
Universal Coordinated Time (@utc{}),

@item
International Atomic Time (@tai{}),

@item
monotonic time (a monotonically increasing point in time from some
epoch, which is implementation--dependent),

@item
@cpu{} time in current thread (implementation dependent),

@item
@cpu{} time in current process (implementation dependent),

@item
time duration.
@end itemize

Implementations are required to implement @utc{}, monotonic time, @cpu{}
time in current process, and time duration.  Implementations are allowed
to create extensions (for example, amount of time spent in garbage
collection).

A @emph{Time} object consists of three components:

@table @emph
@item Time type
A symbol representing the time system representation used.  The
constants @code{TIME-TAI}, @code{TIME-UTC}, @code{TIME-MONOTONIC},
@code{TIME-THREAD}, @code{TIME-PROCESS}, and @code{TIME-DURATION} must
be provided for these symbols.  Implementations should provide constants
for time type extensions.

@item Second
An integer representing the number of whole seconds from ``the epoch''.

@item Nanosecond
An integer of the number of nanoseconds in the fractional portion.
Although a time object has nanosecond precision, clocks may have a lower
resolution.
@end table

A @emph{Date} object, which is distinct from all existing types,
represents a point in time as represented by the Gregorian calendar as
well as by a time zone.  @emph{Date} objects are immutable.  A
@emph{Date} object consists of the following components:

@table @emph
@item Nanosecond
An integer between 0 and 9,999,999, inclusive.

@item Second
An integer 0 and 60, inclusive, (60 represents a leap second).

@item Minute
An integer between 0 and 59, inclusive.

@item Hour
An integer between 0 and 23, inclusive.

@item Day
An integer between 0 and 31, inclusive, the upper limit depending on the
month and year of the point in time.

@item Month
An integer between 1 and 12, inclusive; in which 1 means January, 2
February, and so on.

@item Year
An integer representing the year.

@item Time zone
A integer the number of seconds east of GMT for this timezone.
@end table

A @emph{Julian Day} represents a point in time as a real number of days
since -4714-11-24T12:00:00Z (November 24, -4714 at noon, @utc{}).

A @emph{Modified Julian Day} represents a point in time as a real number
of days since 1858-11-17T00:00:00Z (November 17, 1858 at midnight, UTC).

@node srfi time spec timeobj compar
@appendixsubsubsec Time object comparison procedures


@noindent
All of the time comparison procedures require the time objects to be of
the same type.  It is an error to use these procedures on time objects
of different types.  For the point--in--time measurements (e.g.
@code{time-tai} and @code{time-utc}), the semantics are described in
plain text.  For durations (e.g. @code{time-duration}, @code{time-cpu})
the semantics are described in parentheses.

The following procedures are required.


@defun time<=? @var{time1} @var{time2}
@true{} if @var{time1} is before or at (less than or equal to)
@var{time2}, @false{} otherwise.
@end defun


@defun time<? @var{time1} @var{time2}

@appendixsubsubsec Date to string/string to date converters


@noindent
The following procedures provide conversion to and from strings.  They
are required.  The specification below describes a ``locale''; the
specification of locales is beyond this @srfi{}.


@defun date->string @var{date} [@var{format-string}]
Converts a date to a string, using the format string.  The format string
is copied as is; except escape characters (indicated by the tilde) are
replaced with specfic conversions.  The following table lists the
required conversion specifiers; implementations are free to extend this
list.

@multitable {Escape Char} {scrappy dappy doo, scrappy dappy doo, scappy dappy}
@headitem Escape Char @tab Conversion
@item ~~ @tab a literal ~
@item ~a @tab locale's abbreviated weekday name (Sun...Sat)

@end multitable
@end defun


@defun string->date @func{input-string} @func{template-string}
Converts an input string to a date, using the template string.  The
input string must match the template string as is; except escape
characters (preceded by a the tilde) indicate special converters which
(1) move to the next character in the input string fulfilling a
criterion; (2) read a value, and (3) act on this value in some way. The
table below lists the required converters; implementations are free to
extend this list.
