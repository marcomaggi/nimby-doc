Details for Tue Oct  7, 2008
----------------------------

* Added an appendix for the cord API.

Details for Tue Sep 16, 2008

Details for Fri Aug 29, 2008
----------------------------

* Changed  the  license to  an  adapted  version  of the  GC
  license:  the   words  "program"  and   "code"  have  been
  substituted with "document".

* Moved  all   the  copyright  notices   in  the  "@copying"
  environment so that the "@insertcopying" directive is used
  to include the material in the text.

* Added the detailed node listing to the master menu.


Details for Wed Aug 27, 2008
----------------------------

Due  to personal  learning  problems I  have converted  some
available GC  documentation into Texinfo format.   It is far
from being a good documentation file.  

* not all the  text has been corrected to  use "we" to refer
  to the readers of the document, rather than to the authors
  of GC;

* parts of  the API defined  in header files  different from
  "gc.h" are not documented;

* things  that were confused  in the  original documentation
  are still confused in this document;

* there are errors here and there.

  HB can you  validate the copyright notices and  tell me if
it is a problem for you that I am is distributing this under
the GNU Free Documentation License?   I have added a line of
copyright  for me  as  part  of making  clear  that this  is
unofficial documentation.  Everything can be changed on your
request.

  I  hope that  the  file can  be  used as  a trampoline  to
distribute better GC documentation.
