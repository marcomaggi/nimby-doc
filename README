1. Introduction
---------------

This package is a  distribution of software documentation in
GNU Texinfo  format.  All the documents are  a conversion of
existing  documentation   in  other  formats   from  various
projects, whose code and documentation is distributed on the
Internet.


2. License
----------

All the files have a specific documentation license.


3. Install
----------

See  the "README.build"  file  for the  requirements of  the
building infrastructure.  Do this:

    $ cd package-1.2.3
    $ mkdir "=build"
    $ cd "=build"

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

then do it:

    $ ../configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make tests
    $ make install

  Notice that, by default, only the shared library is built,
the static library is not.  To  build it we have to give the
"--enable-static" option to "configure".

  The Makefile supports  the DESTDIR environment variable to
install files in a  temporary location, example: to see what
will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/package

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/package


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation.


A. Credits
----------

The    conversion   to   Texinfo    is   by    Marco   Maggi

original authors.
