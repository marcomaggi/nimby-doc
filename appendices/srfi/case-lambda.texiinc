@appendixsubsec Abstract


@func{case-lambda}, a syntax for procedures with a variable number of
arguments, is introduced.


@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@c page
@node srfi case-lambda rationale
@appendixsubsec Rationale


@func{case-lambda} reduces the clutter of procedures that execute
different code depending on the number of arguments they were passed; it
is a pattern--matching mechanism that matches on the number of
arguments.  @func{case-lambda} is available in some Scheme systems.

While @func{case-lambda} can be implemented as a macro using only
facilities available in @rnrs{5} Scheme, it admits considerable
implementation--specific optimization.

@appendixsubsec Specification


@deffn Syntax case-lambda @var{clause} ...
Eeach @var{clause} has the format @code{(formals body)}, were
@var{formals} is a formal arguments list as for @func{lambda} (cf
section 4.1.4 of the @rnrs{5}).  Each @var{body} is a @code{tail-body}
(cf section 3.5 of the @rnrs{5}).

A @func{case-lambda} expression evaluates to a procedure that accepts a
variable number of arguments and is lexically scoped in the same manner
as procedures resulting from @func{lambda} expressions.

When the procedure is called with some arguments @var{V1}, ...,
@var{Vk}, then the first clause for which the arguments agree with
@var{formals} is selected, where agreement is specified as for the
@var{formals} of a LAMBDA expression.

The variables of @var{formals} are bound to fresh locations, the values
@var{V1}, ..., @var{Vk} are stored in those locations, the @var{body} is
evaluated in the extended environment, and the results of @var{body} are
returned as the results of the procedure call.

It is an error for the arguments not to agree with the @var{formals} of
any @var{clause}.

Error:

@example
(define plus
  (case-lambda 
    [()         0]
    [(x)        x]
    [(x y)      (+ x y)]
    [(x y z)    (+ (+ x y) z)]
    [args       (apply + args)]))

(plus)                     => 0
(plus 1)                   => 1
(plus 1 2 3)               => 6

((case-lambda 
   [(a)         a]
   [(a b)       (* a b)])
 1 2 3)                    => error
