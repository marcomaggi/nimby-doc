     =================================================


NEWSGROUPS: comp.lang.scheme
SUBJECT: [announce] Texinfo SRFI, 2008-11-10-16-35-17


Although I understand that Texinfo is for the rest of us, as
a  byproduct of  things I  am  interested in  I release  the
following:


<http://sites.google.com/site/mrcmgg/doc/srfi.tar.gz?attredirects=0>


I  accept "bug"  reports and  contributions.  Thanks  to the
SRFI  authors  and   editors  for  freely  distributing  the
original documents.


Details for 2008-11-10-16-35-17
-------------------------------

* Neither all the SRFIs  have been included, nor the missing
  ones  will be  included in  the  future.  I  will add  the
  char-set one sooner or later.
* Occasionally I  avoided sections, but just a  few.  (I can
  remember only one, with a chessboard.)
* Each SRFI document is formatted as "@appendixsec" section,
  not as standalone Texinfo document.
* The file "texinfo-macros.texiinc" holds the Texinfo macros
  required to  format the  documents.  Not all  the included
  macros are needed.
* The file "index.texiinc" loads  the SRFI documents but not
  the macros file.
* The file  "srfi.texi" is  a stub standalone  document that
  loads  the macros  file  "index.texiinc" and  can be  used
  browse the stuff.
* A makefile for GNU make is included.
